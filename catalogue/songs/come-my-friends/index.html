<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cm6ubz1frsf0knx/Come%20my%20friends%20-%20Dmajor.mp3?dl=0">Chipmunk version with whistle</a> -
Originally recorded in C, but the song needs to be in D… so I just raised it.
If WP can get that penny whistle (D) happening, that’d be sweet. Otherwise I’ll
whistle like I did in the recording on our album</p>

<span class="line"><span>Some say I am a traveling man</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     D                      A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Some say I don't stray from home</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Some say I have a heart of gold</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       D                    A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Others swear it's made from stone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     D                            G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've played with the children and made 'em laugh</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         D                 A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I've watched my lovers cry</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        D                         G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But the day that I don't raise my glass with you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       D        A      D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Is the day that I will die</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Chorus:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   G                     D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So come, my friends, and drink with me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     G       A         D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Come drink until we're done</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      D                            G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We'll laugh and we'll sing and our laughter will ring</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Some say I've the patience of God</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Some say the high road is all I'll take</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But not those on whom I've trod</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I struggled a bit, other times I've quit</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It's just part of who I am</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But a friend in need is a friend indeed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I always will do what I can</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Some say I have a quiet soul</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Others say I speak to loud</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Some say I've always been humble and meek</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>While some say I'm much too proud</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've played the fool 'til I'd seen it through</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And it teaches me somehow to think</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Sometimes a mans needs a gentle word</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Often times, he needs a strong drink!</span></span>
