<span class="line"><span>But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in L.A.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I heard that there's a special place</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm having wicked dreams of leaving Tennessee</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Hear Santa Monica, I swear it's callin' me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream</span></span>

<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm up and jaws are on the floor</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Black lights and a mirrored disco ball</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Every night's another reason why I left it all</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I thank my wicked dreams, a year from Tennessee</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, Santa Monica, you've been too good to me</span></span>
