<span class="line"><span>When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And rode us all the way into New Orleans</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Windshield wipers slappin' time, I's holdin' Bobby's hand in mine</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We sang every song that driver knew</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Freedom is just another word for nothin' left to lose</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no-no</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You know feelin' good was good enough for me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Yeah Bobby shared the secrets of my soul</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Yeah, Bobby baby, kept me from the cold</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for one single yesterday</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Freedom is just another word for nothin' left to lose</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me, yeah</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That feelin' good was good enough for me, mmm-hmm</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>La-da-da, la-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da-da</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, Bobby McGee, yeah</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>La, la-la-la-da-da- Bobby McGee, oh yeah</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>La-da-da, la-da-da, la,da-da, la,da-da</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>La-da-da, la-da-da, la-di-da</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Hey now, Bobby now, now Bobby McGee, yeah</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, lo-da-da, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Hey now, Bobby now, now Bobby McGee, yeah</span></span>
