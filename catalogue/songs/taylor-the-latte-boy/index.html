<span class="line"><span>He is very inspirational because of many things</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I come in at 8:11, and he smiles and says, "How are you?"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When he smiles and says, "How are you?"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I could swear my heart grows wings</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So today at 8:11, I decided I should meet him</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I decided I should meet him in a proper, formal way</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So today at 8:11, when he smiled and said, "How are you?"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I said, "Fine, and my name's Kristin"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And he softly answered, "Hey"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I said, "My name is Kristin</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And thank you for the extra foam"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And he said his name was Taylor</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Which provides the inspiration for this poem</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Taylor, the latte boy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Bring me java, bring me joy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, Taylor, the latte boy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him, I love him, I love him</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So I'd like to get my nerve up to recite my poem musical</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He would like the fact it's musical because he plays guitar</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So today at 8:11, Taylor told me he was playing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In a band down in the village, in the basement of a bar</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And he smoothly flipped the lever to prepare my double latte</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But for me, he made it triple, and he didn't think I knew</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I saw him flip the lever, and for me, he made it triple</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I knew the triple latte meant that Taylor loved me too</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I said, "What time are you playing? And thank you for the extra skim"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He said, "Keep the $3.55," because this triple latte was on him (ah, ah)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Taylor, the latte boy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Bring me java, bring me joy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, Taylor, the latte boy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him, I love him, I love him</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I used to be the kind of girl</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Who'd run when love rushed toward her</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But finally a voice whispered, "Love can be yours</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If you step up to the counter and order"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Taylor, the latte boy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Bring me java, bring me joy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, Taylor, the latte boy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him, I love him, I love him</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So many years my heart has waited</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Who'd have thought that love could be so caffeinated?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Taylor, the latte boy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him, I love him, I love him</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him, I love him, I love him (ha)</span></span>
