<span class="line"><span>I don't know if you can see,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Bm                     G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The changes that have come over me.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         D                  A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In these last few days I've been afraid,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     Bm            G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That I might drift away.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          D                A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've been telling stories, singing songs,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     Bm                  G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That make me think about where I come from.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>D                 A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That's the reason why I seem</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   Bm         G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So far away today.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        D                      A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, but let me tell you that I love you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       Bm                      G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That I think about you all the time</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>D                A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Caledonia you're calling me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>            G     D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And now I'm going home</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>D                    A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If I should become a stranger</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>              Bm                         G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You know that it would make me more than sad</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>D                A                    D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Caledonia's been everything I've ever had</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now I have moved and I've kept on moving</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Proved the points that I needed proving</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Lost the friends that I needed losing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Found others on the way</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I have kissed the girls and left them crying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Stolen dreams, yes there's no denying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I have traveled hard with coattails flying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Somewhere in the wind</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now I'm sitting here before the fire</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The empty room, the forest choir</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The flames that could not get any higher</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They've withered now they've gone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I'm steady thinking my way is clear</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I know what I will do tomorrow</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When the hands are shaken and the kisses flow</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then I will disappear</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
