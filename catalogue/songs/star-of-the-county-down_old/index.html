<span class="line"><span>Near to Banbridge Town, in the County Down</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Em           D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>One morning in July,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       Em                  G       D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        Em            Am        Em</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And she smiled as she passed me by;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        G                       D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, she looked so neat from her two white feet</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       Em       Am            D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To the sheen of her nut-brown hair,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         Em               G          D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Sure the coaxing elf, I'd to shake myself</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   Em              Am       Em</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To make sure I was standing there</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Chorus]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         G                D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, from Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         Em              D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And from Galway to Dublin town,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   Em                      G        D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>No maid I've seen like the sweet colleen</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       Em         Am     Em</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That I met in the County Down.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As she onward sped I shook my head</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I gazed with a feeling quare,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I said, says I, to a passer-by,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>"Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, he smiled at me, and with pride says he,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>"That's the gem of Ireland's crown,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She's the Star of the County Down."</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She'd a soft, brown eye, and a look so sly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And a smile like a rose in June</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And you held each note from her lillywhite throat</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As she lilted an Irish tune</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>At the pattern dance, you'll be in a trance</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As she'd trip through a jig or reel</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When her eyes she'd roll, she would soothe the soul</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And your heart she would likely steal</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>At the crossroads fair she'll be surely there</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>With my hat cocked right and my shoes shone bright</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For a smile from the nut-brown Rose.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Though with rust my plow turns brown,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Till a smiling bride by my own fireside</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Sits the Star of the County Down.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Other verses to choose from]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've travelled a bit, but never was hit</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Since my roving career began;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But fair and square I surrendered there</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To the charms of young Rose McCann.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'd a heart to let and no tenant yet</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Did I meet with in shawl or gown,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But in she went and I asked no rent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>>From the Star of the County Down.</span></span>
