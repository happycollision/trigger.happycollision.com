<span class="line"><span>I’ve been down on my luck</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          G          D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Been down   too long this time</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     G               D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I’ve drank em to the bottom</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Til I found myself there too</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And the taste of defeat</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    D             A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Has never been so sweet</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So I pour another glass</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     D    A    D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Fail again and again</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've been down</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I’ve been higher than Sears Tower</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I asked the higher powers</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If they could just spare a drink</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Did they answer my cries?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I was a bit preoccupied</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I toasted them boasted to them</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That they had met their match</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       D                G              D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But as long as there is whiskey in the world</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       D              G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We can drink away the heartache</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       D              A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We can drink away the girls</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       D                   G     D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Who we long to love but we never touch</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   D                A              D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As long as there is whiskey in the world</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  </span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I have loved</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I've lost all that they gave me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They all try to save me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I'm seeing this thing through</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And these feelings of remorse</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They leave me no recourse</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So I pour another glass</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Fail again and again</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Bridge:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A                 D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I DONT WANT TO BE SAVED</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(Speed up)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As long as there is whiskey in the world</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As long as there is whiskey in the world</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As long as there is whiskey</span></span>
