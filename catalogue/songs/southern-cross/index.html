<span class="line"><span>Sailing a reach before a following sea</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She was making for the trades on the outside</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And the downhill run to Papeete</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Off the wind on this heading lie, the Marquesas</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We got 80 feet of the waterline</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Nicely making way</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But on a midnight watch I realized</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Why twice you ran away</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(I think about)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Think about how many times I have fallen</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Spirits are using me, larger voices calling</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>What Heaven brought you and me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I have been around the world (looking)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Looking for that woman-girl</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(And I know she knows)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Who knows love can endure</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And you know it will</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When you see the Southern Cross for the first time</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You understand now why you came this way</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>'Cause the truth you might be running from is so small</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But it's as big as the promise</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The promise of a coming day</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a-dying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And my love is an anchor tied to you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Tied with a silver chain</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I have my ship</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And all her flags are a-flying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She is all that I have left</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And music is her name</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(I think about)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Think about how many times I have fallen</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Spirits are using me, larger voices calling</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>What Heaven brought you and me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I have been around the world (looking)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Looking for that woman-girl</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Who knows love can endure</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And you know it will</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And you know it will</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(Yes)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So we cheated, and we lied, and we tested</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And we never failed to fail</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It was the easiest thing to do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You will survive being bested</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Somebody fine</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Will come along, make me forget about loving you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In the Southern Cross</span></span>
