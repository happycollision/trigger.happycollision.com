<span class="line"><span>Oh, the night that Paddy Murphy died, is a night I'll never forget</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Some of the boys got loaded drunk, and they ain't got sober yet;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   A*                                       D*              A*</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feelin' gay</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   A        N.C.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>O'Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>A                              D               A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That's how they showed their respect for Paddy Murphy</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A                 F#m           D                E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  That's how they showed their honour and their pride;</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>[Verse 2]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As Mrs. Murphy sat in the corner pourin' out her grief</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Kelly and his gang came tearin' down the street</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They went into an empty room and a bottle of whiskey stole</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They put the bottle with the corpse to keep that whiskey cold</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Chorus]</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>[Verse 3]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>About two o'clock in the morning after empty'ing the jug</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Doyle rolls up the ice box lid to see poor Paddy's mug</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We stopped the clock so Mrs. Murphy couldn't tell the time</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And at a quarter after two we argued it was nine</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Chorus]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Verse 4]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, they stopped the hearse on George Street outside Sundance Saloon</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They all went in at half past eight and staggered out at noon</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They went up to the graveyard, so holy and sublime</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Found out when they got there, they'd left the corpse behind!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Chorus]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Verse 5]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, the night that Paddy Murphy died, is a night I'll never forget</span></span>
