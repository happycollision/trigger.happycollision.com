<span class="line"><span>The little old bird woman comes.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In her own special way to the people she calls,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>"Come, buy my bags full of crumbs.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Come feed the little birds, show them you care</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And you'll be glad if you do.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Their young ones are hungry,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Their nests are so bare;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All it takes is tuppence from you."</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Feed the birds, tuppence a bag,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>"Feed the birds," that's what she cries,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>While overhead, her birds fill the skies.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All around the cathedral the saints and apostles</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Look down as she sells her wares.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Although you can't see it, you know they are smiling</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Each time someone shows that he cares.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Though her words are simple and few,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Listen, listen, she's calling to you:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>"Feed the birds, tuppence a bag,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag."</span></span>
