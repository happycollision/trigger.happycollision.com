<pre is:raw="" class="astro-code" style="background-color: #0d1117; overflow-x: auto;"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Chorus:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">C              G               C                  F</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Come on all me hearties, we’ll roam the mountains high</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">C                F           C        G       C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Together we will plunder and together we will die</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">We’ll Wander o’er the valleys, we’ll gallop o’er the plain</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">With scorn to live in slavery, bound down in iron n' chains!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">     C            G               F             C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">It's of a wild colonial boy, Jack Dolan was his name,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">   C               F              C       G     C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Of poor but honest parents he was born in Castlemain.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">He was his father's only hope, his mother's only joy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">And dearly did his parents love their wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">At scarcely eighteen years of age he left his father’s home,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">All through Australia’s sunny clim(ate) a stranger he did roam.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">He robbed those wealthy squatters and their stock he did destroy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">A terror to Australia was the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">In sixty-one this daring youth commenced his wild career,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">With a heart that knew no danger, not a full man did he fear.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Held up the Beechworth mail-coach and he robbed Judge MacEvoy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Who trembled and gave up his gold to the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">One day as he was rambling the mountainside along,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Listening to those little birds, their pleasant laughing song</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">He saw three mounted troopers, Kelly, Davis, and Fitzroy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Who swore that they would capture him, the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">“Surrender now, Jack Dolan, for you see we're three to one</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Surrender now, Jack Dolan, or your life will not be long.”</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Jack pulled a pistol from his belt and shook it up on high</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">“I'll fight but not surrender,” said the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">He fired at Trooper Kelly and he brought him to the ground,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">Then turning round to Davis he received a mortal wound</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">All shattered through the jaw he lay, still firing at Fitzroy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">And that's the way they captured him, the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #c9d1d9">--Chorus--</span></span></code></pre>
