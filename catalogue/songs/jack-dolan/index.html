<span class="line"><span>C              G               C                  F</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Come on all me hearties, we’ll roam the mountains high</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>C                F           C        G       C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Together we will plunder and together we will die</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We’ll Wander o’er the valleys, we’ll gallop o’er the plain</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>With scorn to live in slavery, bound down in iron n' chains!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     C            G               F             C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It's of a wild colonial boy, Jack Dolan was his name,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   C               F              C       G     C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Of poor but honest parents he was born in Castlemain.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He was his father's only hope, his mother's only joy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And dearly did his parents love their wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>At scarcely eighteen years of age he left his father’s home,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All through Australia’s sunny clim(ate) a stranger he did roam.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He robbed those wealthy squatters and their stock he did destroy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A terror to Australia was the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In sixty-one this daring youth commenced his wild career,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>With a heart that knew no danger, not a full man did he fear.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Held up the Beechworth mail-coach and he robbed Judge MacEvoy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Who trembled and gave up his gold to the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>One day as he was rambling the mountainside along,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Listening to those little birds, their pleasant laughing song</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He saw three mounted troopers, Kelly, Davis, and Fitzroy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Who swore that they would capture him, the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>“Surrender now, Jack Dolan, for you see we're three to one</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Surrender now, Jack Dolan, or your life will not be long.”</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Jack pulled a pistol from his belt and shook it up on high</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>“I'll fight but not surrender,” said the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He fired at Trooper Kelly and he brought him to the ground,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then turning round to Davis he received a mortal wound</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All shattered through the jaw he lay, still firing at Fitzroy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And that's the way they captured him, the wild colonial boy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
