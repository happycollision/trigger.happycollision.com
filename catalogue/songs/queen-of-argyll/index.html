<span class="line"><span>Gentle men it is my duty To inform you of one beauty</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Dm                                (G C G C GCDm)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Though I'd ask you of a favor, no to seek her for awhile</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Dm</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Though I own she is a creature Of character and feature</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Dm                                    Am           Dm</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>No words can paint the picture of the Queen of ole Argyll</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Chorus:]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And if you could have seen her there, boys if you had just been there</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The swan was in her movement, and the morning in her smile</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All the roses in the garden, they bow and ask her pardon</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For not one could match the beauty of the queen of ole Argyll</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>On that evening that I mention, I passed with light intention</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Through a part of our dear country known for beauty and for style</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Bein' a place of noble thinkers, of scholars and great drinkers</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But above them all for splendor shone the Queen of Ole Argyll</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So my lads my needs must leave you, my intention not to grieve you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Nor indeed would I deceive you, oh I'll see you in awhile</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I must find some way to gain her, to court her and to tame her</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I fear my heart's in danger from the Queen of ole Argyll</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
