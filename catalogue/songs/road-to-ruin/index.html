<span class="line"><span>You'll just be getting up And I'll still be getting down</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    G               C         G                 D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The band is getting tired But they don't give a damn</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   Em                        D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So blow the girls a kiss And give the boys a hand</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G                C            G              D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You can take the Sunshine     I can take the Moonshine</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Em                                   G    D      G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm on the Road to Ruin     It's the only way to go</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A penny in my pocket A bucket in the well</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then Saturday was Sunday And I could hear the bells</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Deliver me from Evil Forgiveness and for love</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You're heading for confession And I'm heading to the pub</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span>I thought I'd take me chances     But I took one on the chin</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Em                           C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I finally got her number     She wrote it on a cup</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Em                                        D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I phoned her in the morning     And I woke her mudder up</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Em Em C C  (x4)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She wished that I would go to bed I only wished her well</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And then she told me Jesus said that I'd go straight to Hell</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She's following His footsteps I'm following my nose</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We're heading for the same place I'll see you down the road</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus-- x2 (We're on the road to ruin..)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
