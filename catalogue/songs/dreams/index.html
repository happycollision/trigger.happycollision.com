<span class="line"><span>Well, who am I to keep you down?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It's only right that you should play the way you feel it</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But listen carefully to the sound</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Of your loneliness, like a heartbeat drives you mad</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In the stillness of remembering what you had</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And what you lost</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And what you had</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And what you lost</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Players only love you when they're playing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Say, women, they will come and they will go</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>I keep my visions to myself</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Dreams of loneliness, like a heartbeat drives you mad</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In the stillness of remembering what you had</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And what you lost</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And what you had</span></span>
