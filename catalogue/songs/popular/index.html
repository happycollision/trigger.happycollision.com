<span class="line"><span>Less fortunate than I</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(And let's face it - who isn't</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Less fortunate than I?)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>My tender heart Tends to start to bleed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And when someone needs a makeover</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I simply have to take over</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I know I know exactly what they need</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And even in your case</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Tho' it's the toughest case I've yet to face</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Don't worry - I'm determined to succeed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Follow my lead</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And yes, indeed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You will be:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Popular!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You're gonna be popular!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'll teach you the proper ploys</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When you talk to boys</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Little ways to flirt and flounce</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'll show you what shoes to wear</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>How to fix your hair</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Everything that really counts</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To be popular</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'll help you be popular!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You'll hang with the right cohorts</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You'll be good at sports</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Know the slang you've got to know</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So let's start</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>'Cause you've got an awfully long way to go:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Don't be offended by my frank analysis</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Think of it as personality dialysis</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now that I've chosen to be come a pal, a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Sister and adviser</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There's nobody wiser</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Not when it comes to popular -</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I know about popular</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And with an assist from me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To be who you'll bee</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Instead of dreary who-you-were: are:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There's nothing that can stop you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>From becoming popular</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>La la la la</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We're gonna make</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You popular</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When I see depressing creatures</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>With unprepossessing features</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I remind them on their own behalf</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To think of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Celebrated heads of state or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Specially great communicators</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Did they have brains or knowledge?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Don't make me laugh!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They were popular! Please -</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It's all about popular!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It's not about aptitude</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It's the way you're viewed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So it's very shrewd to be</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Very very popular</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Like me!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(spoken) Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you. You're beautiful.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>ELPHABA</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(spoken) I - I have to go:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>GALINDA</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(spoken) You're welcome!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(sung) And though you protest</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Your disinterest</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I know clandestinely</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You're gonna grin and bear it</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Your new found popularity</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>La la la la</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You'll be popular -</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Just not as quite as popular</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As me!</span></span>
