<span class="line"><span>I never cared much for moonlit skies, I never wink back at fireflies</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But now that the stars are in your eyes, I'm beginning to see the light</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I never went in for afterglow, Or candlelight on the mistletoe</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But now when you turn the lamp down low, I'm beginning to see the light</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Used to ramble through the park, Shadow boxing in the dark</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then you came and caused a spark, That's a four-alarm fire, now</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I never made love by lantern shine, I never saw rainbows in my wine</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But now that your lips are burning mine, I'm beginning to see the light</span></span>
