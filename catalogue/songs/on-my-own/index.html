<span class="line"><span>Pretending he's beside me.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All alone,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I walk with him 'til morning.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Without him,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I feel his arms around me.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And when i lose my way i close my eyes</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And he has found me.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In the rain,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The pavement shines like silver.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All the lights are misty in the river.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In the darkness,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The trees are full of starlight.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And all i see is him and me for ever and forever.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And i know</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It's only in my mind,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That i'm talking to myself</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And not to him.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And although i know that he is blind,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Still i say,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There's a way for us.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But when the night is over he is gone.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The river's just a river.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Without him,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The world around me changes.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The trees are bare and everywhere</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The streets are full of strangers.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But every day i'm learning</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All my life,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've only been pretending!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Without me,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>His world will go on turning,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A world that's full of happiness that i have never known!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him...</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him...</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I love him...</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But only on my own...</span></span>
