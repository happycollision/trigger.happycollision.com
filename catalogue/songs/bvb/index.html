<span class="line"><span>           G                          C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well, in a neat little town they call Belfast,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A7                        D7</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>apprentice to trade I was bound</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G                   Em</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Many an hours sweet happiness,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       C             D7          G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>have I spent in that neat little town</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A sad misfortune came over me,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>which caused me to stray from the land</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Far away from my friends and relations,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>betrayed by the black velvet band</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>CHORUS:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Her eyes they shone like diamonds</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I thought her the queen of the land</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And her hair it hung over her shoulder</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Tied up with a black velvet band</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Verse 2:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I took a stroll down Broadway,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>meaning not long for to stay</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>comes a tripping along the highway</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She was both fair and handsome,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>her neck it was just like a swans</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And her hair it hung over her shoulder,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(everyone joins with energy)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>tied up with a black velvet band</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--CHORUS--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Verse 3:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and a gentleman passing us by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well I knew she meant the doing of him,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>by the look in her roguish black eye</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A gold watch she took from his pocket</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and placed it right in to my hand</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And the very first thing that I said was</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>bad luck to the black velvet band</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--CHORUS--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Verse 4:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Before the judge and the jury,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>next morning I had to appear</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The judge he says to me: "Young man,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>your case it is proven clear</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We'll give you seven years penal servitude,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to be spent faraway from the land</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Far away from your friends and companions,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>betrayed by the black velvet band"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span>When you are out on the town me lads,</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>For they feed you with strong drink, "Oh yeah",</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>'til you are unable to stand -</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And the very next thing that you'll know is</span></span>
