<span class="line"><span>As I was going over the far fam'd Kerry Mountains,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  G                                D            A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I met with Captain Farrel, and his money he was countin',</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  D                               Bm</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I first produced my pistol, and I than produced my rapier,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         G                         D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Sayin': "Stand and deliver for you are a bold deceiver".</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Musha ring dum a doo dum a da,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Whack for the daddy ol',</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Whack for the daddy ol',</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        D       A      D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There's whiskey in the jar.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I put it in my pocket, and I took it home to Jenny,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She sighed, and she swore that she never would deceive me,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But the devil take the women for they never can be easy.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But Jenny drew my charges and she filled them out with water,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then sent for Captain Farrel, to be ready for the slaughter.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>'Twas early in the morning just before I rose to travel,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Up comes a band of footmen and likewise, Captain Farrel,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I first produced my pistol for she stole away my rapier,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now there's some take delight in the carriages a rolling</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>but I take delight in the juice of the barley</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If anyone can aid me 'tis my brother in the army,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If I can find his station, in Cork or in Killarney,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And if he'll go with me we'll go roving in Kilkenny,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my old a-sporting Jenny.</span></span>
