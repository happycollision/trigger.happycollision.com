<span class="line"><span>And one could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his share</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He fumbled round until he could no longer keep his feet</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And one says to the other with a twinkle in her eye</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And there behold, for them to view, beneath his Scottish skirt</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They marveled for a moment, then one said we must be gone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Let's leave a present for our friend, before we move along</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon, tied into a bow</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Around the bonnie star, the Scot's kilt did lift and show</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Around the bonnie star, the Scots kilt did lift and show</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled toward the trees</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Behind a bush, he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>O lad I don't know where you been but I see you won first prize</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ring ding diddle iddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>O lad I don't know where you been but I see you won first prize</span></span>
