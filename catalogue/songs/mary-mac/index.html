<span class="line"><span>G  D   E     X4</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There's a wee little lass and her name is Mary Mac</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Lots of other fellas wanna' get up on her back,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G                   D                       E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>but I think they're gonna' have to get up early.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Mary Mac's mother's makin' Mary Mac marry me!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>My mother's makin' me marry Mary mac!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well I'm gonna marry Mary for when Mary's takin' care o' me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G                   D                        E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We'll all be feelin' merry when I marry Mary Mac!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G                   D                E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Kaiyut-little-ottle-eetle-ottle-eetle-um!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G   D   E  X2</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now this wee lass, she has a lot of class.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She has a lot of brass and her mother thinks I'm a gas.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So I'd be a silly ass if I let the matter pass,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for my mother thinks she suits me rather fairly.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus...</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now Mary and her mother gang an awful lot together.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In fact you hardly see the one or the one without the other.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And the lads often wonder if it's Mary or her mother</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>or the both of them together that I'm courtin'.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus...</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I said, well bonnie lass, where you gonna spend the day?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She said, among the heather and the hills of Banoffee,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>where all the boys and girls are makin' it for free,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>up among the heather and the hills of Banoffee.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus...</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The wedding's on Wednesday. Everything's arranged.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Soon her name will change to mine unless her mind be changed.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We're makin' the arrangements and I'm just a bit deranged.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For marriage is an awful undertakin'.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus...</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It's sure to be a grand affair and grander than a fair.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There's gonna be a coach and pair for every couple there.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We'll dine upon the finest fare. I'm sure to get my share.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If I don't we'll all be very much mistaken.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus...</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There's a wee little lass and her name is Mary Mac</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Lots of other fellas tryin' to get up on her back,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>but I think they're gonna have to get up early.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus...</span></span>
