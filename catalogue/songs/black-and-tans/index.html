<span class="line"><span>       Dm                                C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I was born on a Dublin street where the Royal drums do beat</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         Dm</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And the loving English feet they walked all over us</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      F                                   C       Am</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And every single night when me da would come home tight</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       Dm                 C                  Dm</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He'd invite the neighbors outside with this chorus</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Oh, come out you black and tans</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>             C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Come out and fight me like a man</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>           Dm              C            Dm</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>From the green and lovely lanes in Killashandra</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Verse 2]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Come let me hear you tell</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>How you slandered great Parnell</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When you thought him well and truly persecuted</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Where are the sneers and jeers</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That you loudly let us hear</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When our heroes of sixteen were executed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span>[Verse 3]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Come tell us how you slew</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Those ol' Arabs two by two</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Like the Zulus they had spears and bows and arrows</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>How you bravely faced one</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>With your sixteen pounder gun</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And you frightened them poor natives to their marrow</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span>[Verse 4]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now the time is coming fast</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I think them days are here</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When each English yeoman he will run before us</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And if there be a need</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then our kids will say, "Godspeed!"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>With a verse or two of singing this fine chorus</span></span>
