<span class="line"><span>There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You became the light on the dark side of me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But did you know that when it snows</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>My eyes become large and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The light that you shine can't be seen?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And now that your rose is in bloom</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>I've been kissed by a rose on the grey</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I, I've been kissed by a rose on the grey</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've been kissed by a rose on the grey (and if I should fall, would it all go away?)</span></span>
