Am I alright?)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ask me, how do I feel</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ask me, now that we're cosy and clinging</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well sir, all I can say, is if I were a bell I'd be ringing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>From the moment we kissed tonight</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That's the way I've just gotta behave</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And If I were a banner I'd wave</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ask me, how do I feel</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Little me with my quiet upbringing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well sir, all I can say is if gate I'd be swinging</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And if I were a watch I'd start popping my springs</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ask me, how do I feel</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>From this chemistry lesson I'm learning</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Uh, chemistry?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well sir, all I can say is if I were a bridge I'd be burning</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Yes, I knew my moral would crack</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>From the wonderful way that you looked</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ask me, how do I feel</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ask me, now that we're fondly caressing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well, if I were a salad I know I'd be splashing my dressing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ask me, how to describe this whole beautiful thing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well, if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding</span></span>
