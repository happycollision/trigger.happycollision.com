<span class="line"><span>it takes all the army and the navy to put the wind up Sylvest.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well, He thought he'd take a trip to Italy and he thought that he'd go by sea.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He jumped off the harbour in New York and he swam like a man made of Cork.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He saw the Lusitania in distress; (WHAT'D HE DO?)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        He put the Lusitania on his chest (BIG CHEST)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then he drank all the water in the sea and he walked all the way to Italy.</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>[Chorus]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span>He thought he'd take a trip to old Japan and they called out the whole brass band.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You can take all the instruments you got;  We got a lad who can play the whole lot,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now the old church bells will ring (HELLS BELLS)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        and the old church choir will sing (HELL'S FIRE)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They all turned out to say farewell, To my big brother Sylvest.</span></span>
