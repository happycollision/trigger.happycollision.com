<span class="line"><span>On the fourth of July eighteen hundred and six</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       G                          D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>we set sail from the Cobh quay of Cork</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        G                   C        G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        G          D           G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for the grand city hall in New York</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         G                      D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>'Twas an elegant craft, she was rigged fore and aft</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G                       D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and how the trade winds drove her</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>She had twenty three masts and she stood several blasts</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         G              D        G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and they called her the Irish Rover</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Verse 2:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We had two million barrels of stones</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We had three million sides of old blind horses hides</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We had four million barrels of bone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We had five million hogs, six million dogs</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Seven million barrels of porter</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We had eight million bales of old nanny goats tails</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In the hold of the Irish Rover</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Verse 3:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There was Hogan from County Tyrone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There was Johnny McGuirk who was scared stiff of work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And a chap from Westmeath called Malone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And your man Mick Mc Cann from the banks of the Bann</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Was the skipper of the Irish Rover</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Last Verse:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and our ship lost it's way in the fog</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then the whole of the crew was reduced down to two</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>just myself and the captain's old dog</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The ship struck a rock, oh Lord what a shock</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and nearly tumbled over</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(Slow Down)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(A Tempo)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm the last of the Irish Rover</span></span>
