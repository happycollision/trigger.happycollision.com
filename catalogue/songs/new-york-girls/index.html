<span class="line"><span>As I walked out on Broadway, one evening last July</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  G              C                  G        D       G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I met a maid she asked me trade, "a sailor lad" says I</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To Tiffany's I took her I didn’t mind expense</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I bought her a pair of gold earrings, they cost me fifteen cents</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus (twice every time)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Away Santee My Dear Annie</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Oh, you New York girls can't you dance the polka?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And she says, 'You Limejuice sailor Now see me home you may'</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But when we reached her cottage door She this to me did say:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>“My flash man he's a Yankee With his hair cut short behind</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He wears a pair of black sea-boots And he sails in the Blackball Line”</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--CHORUS--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And He's homeward bound this evening And with me he will stay</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So get a move on, sailor-boy Get cracking on your way</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I kissed her hard and proper Afore her flash man came</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So fare thee well, you Bowery girl I know your little game</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--CHORUS--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And then I wrapped me glad rags round me And to the docks did steer</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I will never court another girl I'll stick to rum and beer</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I joined a Yankee blood-boat And sailed away next morn</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Don't mess around with women boys You're safer ‘round Cape Horn</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--CHORUS--</span></span>
