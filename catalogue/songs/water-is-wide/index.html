<span class="line"><span>There is a ship and she sails the sea;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>She's loaded deep as deep can be;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But not so deep as the love I'm in:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I know not how I sink or swim.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I leaned my back up against an oak.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I thought it was a trusty tree.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But first it swayed, and then it broke,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So did my love prove false to me.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>O, love is handsome, and love is fine.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And love is charming when it is true.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But love grows old, and waxes cold,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And fades away, like morning dew.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The water is wide,   I cannot get o'er;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And neither have I      wings to fly;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Give me a boat    that can carry two,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And both shall row,    my love and I.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And both shall row, my love and I</span></span>
