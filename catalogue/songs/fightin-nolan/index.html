<span class="line"><span>D  G  D  A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>D  G  D  A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Verse 1]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         D                             G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Have you seen Fightin' Nolan, Fightin' Nolan Kennedy?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   D                                   A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He fought his way from Belfast all the way to the prairie</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       D                          G</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He's a rouge and a rambler with a powerful thirst</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   D                                A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He loves to court the fellas but he drinks his whiskey first</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Chorus]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So raise em up, raise em up, here's to you and me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Here's a toast for all the lads in the company</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now drink em down, drink em down, next one's on me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      D                           G                 A         D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>We're gonna paint this town red before we cross the sea</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Verse 2]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now Fightin' Nolan is a small, mountain of a man</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He fought and killed a lion with his bare hands</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He's a joker and a braggart and he's tough as nails</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And before he starts his day he drinks a cask full of ale</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Chorus]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And Fightin' Nolan is wanted by the ladies and the law</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He's the smartest, toughest, bravest man that you ever saw</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>He was marked for execution to be buried in the sand</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Til he helped St. Patrick drive the snakes out of Ireland</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Chorus]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Chorus, slow down at altered final line:]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And here's one final toast to our friend Nolan Kennedy</span></span>
