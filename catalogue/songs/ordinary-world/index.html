<span class="line"><span>Thought I heard you talking softly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Still I can't escape the ghost of you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>What has happened to it all?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Crazy, some'd say</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Where is the life that I recognise? (Gone away)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Somehow I have to find</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I will learn to survive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>"Pride will tear us both apart"</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well, now pride's gone out the window</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>'Cross the rooftops, run away</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Left me in the vacuum of my heart</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>What is happening to me?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Crazy, some'd say</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Where is my friend when I need you most? (Gone away)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Somehow I have to find</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I will learn to survive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ah-ah-ah</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Gone away</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh-oh</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Fear today, forgot tomorrow</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ooh-ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Ours is just a little sorrowed talk</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Just blowing away</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I don't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Somehow I have to find</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>I will learn to survive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(Every world is my world) I will learn to survive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(Any world is my world) I will learn to survive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(Any world is my world)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(Every world is my world)</span></span>
