<span class="line"><span>I never tried to make you think or let you see</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>One thing for yourself</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But now you're off with someone else and I'm alone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You see I thought that I might keep you for my own</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Amie, what you wanna do?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I think I could stay with you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For a while, maybe longer if I do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Don't you think the time is right for us to find</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And can you see</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Which way we should turn, together or alone?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I can never see what's right or what is wrong</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, you take too long</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Amie, what you wanna do?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I think I could stay with you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For a while, maybe longer if I do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(...)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well, Amie, what you wanna do?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I think I could stay with you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For a while, maybe longer if I do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now it's come to what you want, you've had your way</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And all the things you thought before just faded into gray</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And can you see</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That I don't know if it's you or if it's me?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If it's one of us, I'm sure we both will see</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Won't you look at me and tell me?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Amie, what you wanna do?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I think I could stay with you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For a while, maybe longer if I, longer if I do, yeah, now</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Amie, what you wanna do?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I think I could stay with you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For a while, maybe longer if I do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I keep falling in and out of love with you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Falling in and out of love with you</span></span>
