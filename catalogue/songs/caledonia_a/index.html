<span class="line"><span>I don't know if you can see,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    F#m                    D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The changes that have come over me.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>         A                  E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In these last few days I've been afraid,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     F#m           D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That I might drift away.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          A                E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've been telling stories, singing songs,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     F#m                 D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That make me think about where I come from.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A                 E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That's the reason why I seem</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   F#m        D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So far away today.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Chorus:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        A                      E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Oh, but let me tell you that I love you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       F#m                     D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>That I think about you all the time</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A                E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Caledonia you're calling me</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>            D     A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>End now I'm going home</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A                    E</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If I should become a stranger</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>              F#m                        D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You know that it would make me more than sad</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A                E                    A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Caledonia's been everything I've ever had</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now I have moved and I've kept on moving</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Proved the points that I needed proving</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Lost the friends that I needed losing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Found others on the way</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I have kissed the girls and left them crying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Stolen dreams, yes there's no denying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I have traveled hard with coattails flying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Somewhere in the wind</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>A E F#m D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now I'm sitting here before the fire</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The empty room, the forest choir</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The flames that could not get any higher</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They've withered now they've gone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I'm steady thinking my way is clear</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I know what I will do tomorrow</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When the hands are shaken and the kisses flow</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then I will disappear</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>--Chorus (last line 3 times)--</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[humming]</span></span>
