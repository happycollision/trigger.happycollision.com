<span class="line"><span>When I hear a command I obey.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I know of a spot in my house</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>where no one can stand in my way.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In my own little corner in my own little chair</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I can be whatever I want to be.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>On the wings of my fancy I can fly anywhere</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and the world will open its arms to me.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm a young Egyptian princess or a milkmaid</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm the greatest prima donna in Milan</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm an heiress who has always had her silk made</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>By her own flock of silkworms in Japan</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm a girl men go mad for love's a game I can play with a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>cool and confident kind of air.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Just as long as I stay in my own little corner</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All alone in my own little chair.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I can be whatever I want to be.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm a thief from Calcutta I'm a queen in Peru.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm a mermaid dancing upon the sea</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm a huntress on an African safari..</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>it's a dangerous type of sport and yet it's fun</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In the night I sally forth to seek my quarry</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I find I forgot to bring my gun.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I am lost in the jungle all alone and unarmed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>when I meet a lioness in her lair</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Then I'm glad to be back in my own little corner,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All alone in my own little chair.</span></span>
