<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It’s plain and well known it’s for him alone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Their hearts are all pinin’</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>There’s an almighty gasp as he loosens the clasp</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of his collar stiff an’ shinin’</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>With neck bare and bold, he hugs and he holds</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Every female over sixty years old</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>The boys sit and stare, it’s a hard cross they bear</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>all this jivin’ and jiltin’</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The girls in fine show all sit in a row</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Like wallflowers wiltin’</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Fellas fume and frustrate while the old women wait</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And the band crucifies Dire Straits</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>And the girls are watching young</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Father Mallory dance</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All chosen and chaste, my God what a waste</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All these vows he won’t question</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Or does he relish the test of each heaving breast</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Full of hope and suggestion</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A blush to their cheeks, when he finally speaks</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Saying, “See you in confession next week”</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And the girls are watching young</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Father Mallory dance</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>Oh Father McVeigh, fair blesses the day</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Of this young preist’s selection</span></span>
