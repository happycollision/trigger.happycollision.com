<span class="line"><span>Whiskey, Whiskey, Nancy Whiskey</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G                 D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Whiskey, Whiskey, Nancy-O</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G               C</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've got silver in me pocket</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>G                     D</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I'll follow where e'er you go</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I'm a weaver, a Calton weaver, I'm a rash and a roving blade</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I've got silver in my pockets and I follow the roving trade</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As I went down through Glasgow City, Nancy Whiskey I chanced to smell</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I went in, sat down beside her, seven long years I loved her well</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The more I kissed her, the more I loved her, the more I kissed her, the more she smiled</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Soon I forgot my mother's teaching, Nancy soon had me beguiled</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Now, I rose early in the morning, to slake my thirst, it was my need</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I tried to rise but I was not able, Nancy had me by the knees</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So I'm going back to the Calton weaving, I'll surely make them shuttles fly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For I'll make more at the Calton weaving than ever I did in the roving way</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>So come all you weavers, you Calton weavers, come all you weavers, where e'er you be</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Beware of Whiskey, Nancy Whiskey, she'll ruin you like she ruined me</span></span>
