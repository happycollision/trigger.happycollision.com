<span class="line"><span>I hear the train a comin', it's rollin' round the bend</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>                                                 E7</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When I was just a baby my Mama told me "Son</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns".</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>[Solo]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>They're probably drinking coffee and smokin' big cigars</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well, I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>But those people keep a movin' and that's what tortures me</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>[Solo]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away</span></span>
