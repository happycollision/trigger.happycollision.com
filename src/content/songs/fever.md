title: Fever
---

```
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever
In the mornin'
A fever all through the night

Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
A fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, "Daddy, oh, don't you dare"

He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever
I'm his missus
daddy, won't you treat him right?

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever
When you kiss them
Fever, if you live you learn
Fever
'Til you sizzle

what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
And what a lovely way to burn
```
