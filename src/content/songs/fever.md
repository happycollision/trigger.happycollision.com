title: Fever
---

```
[Verse 1]
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

[Chorus]
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm going to treat you right

[Chorus]
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Bridge]
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
```
