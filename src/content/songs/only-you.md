title: Only You
---

```
[Verse 1]
Only you, nobody else will do
Remember that whenever you're sad
Only you, not anybody new
You're still the best friend I've ever had
Remember how I used to say
I couldn't promise you I'd stay
I've always been here anyway
As if I'd met you yesterday

[Refrain]
On my own, I'd get along alright
As long as you don't wander too far
On my own, I can make it through the night
As long as I know right where you are

[Refrain 2]
I love the way you look, it's true
But if you change, that's alright too
No matter what you ever do, there's only me and only you

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
On my own, I get along alright
As long as you don't wander too far
On my own, I can make it through the night
As long as I know right where you are
```
