I've changed all the C# to C#m, as I am pretty sure that is what is actually
going on. You can also use F#m (or A) to transitions between E and D or from D
to E pretty much every time it happens. Especially when there is a strong
emphasis on that passing note.

```
[Chorus - a capella]
Oh Maggie, give me one more chance,
I swear I’ll make everything right.
Oh Maggie, can I have this dance?
                Build......E.......A
Please stay ay ay ay, tonight

[Verse 1]
E            F#m             D   (F#m)  E
Walking down broadway in the blinding   light
            F#m           A
The city is ringing in my ears
E         F#m            D          E           D
Trying to work out how a few months turned into years
E               F#m               D   E
She cradles the young ones by the fireside
           F#m          A
Smoldering embers among tears
E              F#m                D          E          D
Collects a few bar bites and each fortnight, I'm in her ears.
        E
And she fears, and I say.


[Chorus]
D     A               E   A    D
   Oh Maggie, give me one more chance,
             A               C#m
I swear I’ll make everything right.
D     A             E    A    D
   Oh Maggie, can I have this dance?
                  E      A
Please stay ay ay ay, tonight

[Verse 2]
E           F#m            D       E
Millions of people on this crowded street
           F#m         A
I've never felt so all alone
E          F#m        D          E          D
Longing to see her is all that's keeping me going
E          F#m            D     E
Maggie, if only you would understand
      F#m              A
Being apart can set us free
E               F#m           D    E                D
Its just taking longer than I ever thought it would be
   E
Oh believe me, when I say

[Chorus]
D     A               E   A    D
   Oh Maggie, give me one more chance,
             A               C#m
I swear I’ll make everything right.
D     A             E    A    D
   Oh Maggie, can I have this dance?
                  E      A
