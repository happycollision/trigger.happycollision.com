[Verse 1]
         D Dmaj7     D7                   G        Gm
Oh Danny boy,    the pipes, the pipes are calling
             D         Bm               E7   A
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
             D Dmaj7  D7            G     Gm
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
               D   Bm      Em     A      D
'Tis you, 'tis you    must go and I must bide

[Chorus]
A   Bm   A/C#  D         G               D
But come ye   back when summer's in the meadow
A  Bm   A/C#  Bm      G          D          E7   A
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
            D D/F#   G        E/G#   D  F#m/C# Bm Bm7/A Gm
And I'll be here in sunshine or in sha-     dow
         D       Bm    Em    A        D      A7/C#
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so


[Verse 2]
          D Dmaj7  D7            G     Gm
But if ye come and all the roses dying
         D A/C#    Bm     Bm/A     E/G#    A
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
                D Dmaj7  D7               G     Gm
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying
              D  Bm    G   A         D
And kneel and say   an Ave there for me

[Chorus]
A  Bm A/C#   D            G               D
And I shall feel, though soft you tread above me
A   Bm   A/C# Bm Bm/A   G       D/F#       E/G#   A
And all  my grave will warmer, sweeter be
A   Bm7 A/C#  D    D/F# G       E/G#     D   F#m/C#  Bm  Bm7/A  Bb7
For you will bend and tell me that you lo- ve    me
            D        Bm      Em      A       D   A7
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me

         D       Bm7   Em7   A11     D/A
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so
