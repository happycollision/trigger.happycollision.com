title: Do Nothing Til You Hear From Me
---

```
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dreams
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But, please, do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will

[Chorus]

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But, please, do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Please do nothing til you hear it from me baby,
And you never will
```
