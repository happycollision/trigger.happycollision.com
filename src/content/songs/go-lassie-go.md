```
       D      G       D
Oh the summer time is comin'
        G                 F#m
And the trees are sweetly bloomin'
        G    A        Bm
And the wild mountain thyme
       G                  Em
grows around the bloomin' heather


Chorus:
Will ye go, lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the bloomin' heather
        D   G       D
Will ye go, lassie, go?


I will build my love a bower
Near yon pure and crystal fountian
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain

--Chorus--

If my true love she were gone
I would surely find another
Where wild mountain thyme
Grow around the bloomin' heather

--Chorus--

--Repeat verse 1--

--Chorus--
```
