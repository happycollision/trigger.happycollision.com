title: Almost Like Being In Love
---

```
[Verse 1]
What a day this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why, it's almost like being in love
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why, it's almost like being in love

[Bridge]
There's a music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peel
I would swear I was falling, swear I was falling
Why, it's almost like being in love

[Instrumental Break]

[Scatting]

[Outro]
The music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing just for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peel
I would swear I was falling, swear I was falling
Why, it's almost like being in love
