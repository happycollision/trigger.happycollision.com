```
  G             C         G
I saw her there fade from afar
    G         C
Her hair gray charcoal
        G             D
Takes a drag from her tar.
  C            D
I kissed her a smile,
        G          C
but her blood red, shut eyes
          C         D                G
Said "the son never shines on closed doors."

It's been eight long years since I saw
The woman who's labored
Since the day I was born.
Those wrinkles now face
To that cold dark damp place,
Where the son never shines on closed doors.

Chorus:
             C                          G
She said the son never shines on closed doors
  C                 G          D
I open to find only hurricanes blow.
C        D            G               C
Takes me away, to the green fields of May,
            C         D                G
Because the son never shines on closed doors.

Death comes like a thief in the night
To steal while you sleep,
the soul's flickering light.
Well maybe it's then,
she said I'll see you again,
Because the son never shines on closed doors.

--Chorus--

Outro:
       D          C        G
And we all go the same way home,
[Repeat until end]
```
