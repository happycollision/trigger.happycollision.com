[Intro]
| G     D/F#  | C         |
| G D/F# Em D | C         |


[Verse 1]
G                          D                  C
  We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
G             D                  C
  This is our place, we make the rules
              G                  D             C
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
G                     D             C
  Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?


[Chorus]
    G     D         C
Can I go where you go?
       G      D       C
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
    G            D               C
And ah, take me out, and take me home
       G   D/F# Em  D  C N.C.
You're my, my,  my, my   lover


| G     D/F#  | C         |


[Verse 2]
G                   D               C
  We could let our friends crash in the living room
G             D                  C
  This is our place, we make the call
        G                      D                     C
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
     G                            D                  C
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all


[Chorus]
G        D         C
Can I go where you go?
        G     D       C
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
    G           D                C
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
       G   D/F# Em  D  C   N.C.
You're my, my,  my, my       lover


[Bridge]
G                     D/F#
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
Em                       G7/F
With every guitar string scar on my hand
C                    Em/B                 Am     D
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my ... lover
G                            D/F#
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
Em                           G7/F
All's well that ends well to end up with you
C                  Em/B              Am     D
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my ... lover
    G                    G7/F             C
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
             Am                     D
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover


[Chorus]
    G    D         C
Can I go where you go?
        G     D       C
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
    G           D                C
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
       G   D/F# Em  D  C
You're my, my,  my, my
           G   D/F# Em  D  C
Oh, you're my, my,  my, my
                G   D/F# Em  D  C N.C.
Darling, you're my, my,  my, my   lover
