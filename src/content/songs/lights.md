[Intro]

D Bm D A  Bm C  D Dsus2 D

[Chorus]

         D         Bm          C
When the lights go down in the City
        D          Bm     C
And the sun shines on the bay
     D          Bm          C
Do I want to be there in my City, woh-oh-oh
Bm   C    D Dsus2 D
Ooh, ooh  oooh

D       Bm           C
 So you think you're lonely
D        Bm         C
 Well my friend I'm lonely too
D              Bm         C
 I want to get back to my City by the bay
Bm   C    D Dsus2 D
Ooh, ooh  oooh

[Bridge]

     Bm   G                D                            Bm
It's sad, oh, there's been mornings out on the road without you,
G             D   A  Bm
 Without your charms,
G             D
 Ooh, my, my, my, my, my, my
Bm   C    D Dsus2 D
Ooh, ooh  oooh

[Chorus]

         D         Bm          C
When the lights go down in the City
        D          Bm     C
And the sun shines on the bay
     D          Bm          C
Do I want to be there in my City, woh-oh-oh
Bm   C    D Dsus2 D
Ooh, ooh  oooh
