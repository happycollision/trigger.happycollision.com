G               D
I don't know if you can see,
    Em                     C
The changes that have come over me.
         G                  D
In these last few days I've been afraid,
     Em            C
That I might drift away.
          G                D
I've been telling stories, singing songs,
     Em                  C
That make me think about where I come from.
G                 D
That's the reason why I seem
   Em         C
So far away today.


Chorus:
        G                      D
Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
       Em                      C
That I think about you all the time
G                D
Caledonia you're calling me
            C     G
Dnd now I'm going home
G                    D
If I should become a stranger
              Em                         C
You know that it would make me more than sad
G                D                    G
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had



Now I have moved and I've kept on moving
Proved the points that I needed proving
Lost the friends that I needed losing
Found others on the way
I have kissed the girls and left them crying
Stolen dreams, yes there's no denying
I have traveled hard with coattails flying
Somewhere in the wind


--Chorus--

[Instrumental - half a verse]
G D Em C
G D Em C

Now I'm sitting here before the fire
The empty room, the forest choir
The flames that could not get any higher
They've withered now they've gone
But I'm steady thinking my way is clear
And I know what I will do tomorrow
When the hands are shaken and the kisses flow
Then I will disappear


--Chorus--
--Chorus (last line 3 times)--

[humming]
G D Em C, G
