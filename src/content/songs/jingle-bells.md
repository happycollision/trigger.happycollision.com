title: Jingle Bells

```
(8 measures of band intro)

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on boobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight, oh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

 jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

(4 bars band)

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song

Just bet a boobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack, you'll take the lead

(Band, scat, band, scat)

(Band 8 m, band 8 more measures)

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh hey!

(Key change)

(1 m rest) jingle bells,
Jingle, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

(Band 1m)
Jingle bells
(Band 1m)
All the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

(Band 1m)
Jingle bells
(Quick) Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

(Band then piano solo repeated 3X)

(Wait for hits then:)
I'm just crazy about horses
