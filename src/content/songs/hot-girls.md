title: Hot Girls

```
You are what you eat
That makes me eagle meat
Is black hole death alright?
Is that rat shit or rice?
Do reflections have backs?
purgatory have snacks?

[Chorus]
That's what I'm thinking
While I am racing
All thoughts come to me
While I am racing
Rather be free
So I sink into the deep end of my own sea
That's what I'm thinking of

[Verse 2]
Sell a 3D movie
Then just put on a play
I bench less on Jupiter
Is Knower popular?
Do barnacles get bored?
Do hot girls like chords?

[Chorus]
That's what I'm thinking
While I am racing
All thoughts come to me
While I am racing
Rather be free
So I sink into the deep end of my own sea
That's what I'm thinking of

(Weird interlude, then 16 bars of solo, then back to CHORUS)
