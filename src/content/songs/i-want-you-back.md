```
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
Now that I've seen you in his arms

Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you boy
That I know wrong from right

Every street I walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the boy I didn't even want around

Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
Now that I've seen you in his arms
```
