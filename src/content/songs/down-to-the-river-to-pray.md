[Verse]
          D
As I went down in the river to pray
A7                  D
Studying about that good old way
    D
And who shall wear the starry crown
     A     G           D
Good lord, show me the way

[Chorus]
A7         D
O sisters, let's go down
          G             D
Let's go down, come on down
A7         D
O sisters, let's go down,
G                    D
Down in the river to pray


[Verse 2: robe and crown]
[Chorus 2: brothers]

[Verse 3: starry crown]
[Chorus 3: fathers]

[Verse 4: robe and crown]
[Chorus 4: mothers]

[Verse 5: starry crown]
[Chorus 5: sinners]

[Verse 6: robe and crown]
