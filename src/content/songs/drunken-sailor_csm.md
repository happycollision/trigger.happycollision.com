```
[Verse 1]
C#m
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
B
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
C#m                       E
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
G#m    B      C#m
Ear-ly in the morning


[Chorus]
Weigh, hey, and up she rises
Weigh, hey, and up she rises
Weigh, hey, and up she rises
Ear-ly in the morning


[Verse 2]
Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober
Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober
Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober
Ear-ly in the morning


Pull out the plug and wet him all over

Put him in the bilge and make him drink it

Put him in a leaky boat and make him bale her

Tie him to the scuppers with the hose pipe on him

Shave his belly with a rusty razor

Tie him to the topmast while she's yardarm under

Heave him by the leg in a runnin' bowline

Keel haul him 'til he's sober

Put him in the brig with the captain's daughter


C#m
That's what we do with the drunken sailor!
B
That's what we do with the drunken sailor!
C#m
That's what we do with the drunken sailor!
C#m  B        C#m
Ear-ly in the morning


[Chorus]
