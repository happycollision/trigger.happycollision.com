title: "Too Close For Comfort"
---

```
Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
Don't give up your cart when he’s so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your feet, he’s so close for comfort

Too close, too close for comfort, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
He’s much too close for comfort now

(Short instrumental)

Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
Don't give up your cart when he’s so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your feet, he’s so close for comfort

(Band phrase) (improv)please, not again
(Band phrase) just when do I say when

(BAND FIRST) be firm
(BAND) be fair,
(BAND) be sure,
(BAND) beware, (BAND)
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
He’s much too close for comfort now

(Longer instrumental)

Too close, please not again
Too close, to know just when to say when
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
He’s much too close for comfort now

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
He’s much too close for comfort now
