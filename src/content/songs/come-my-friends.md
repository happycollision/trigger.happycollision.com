[Chipmunk version with whistle](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cm6ubz1frsf0knx/Come%20my%20friends%20-%20Dmajor.mp3?dl=0) -
Originally recorded in C, but the song needs to be in D... so I just raised it.
If WP can get that penny whistle (D) happening, that'd be sweet. Otherwise I'll
whistle like I did in the recording on our album

```
D               G
Some say I am a traveling man
     D                      A
Some say I don't stray from home
D                 G
Some say I have a heart of gold
       D                    A
Others swear it's made from stone
     D                            G
I've played with the children and made 'em laugh
         D                 A
And I've watched my lovers cry
        D                         G
But the day that I don't raise my glass with you
       D        A      D
Is the day that I will die


Chorus:
   G                     D
So come, my friends, and drink with me
     G       A         D
Come drink until we're done
      D                            G
We'll laugh and we'll sing and our laughter will ring
  D       A           D
Until the mornin' has come



Some say I am an angry young man
Some say I've the patience of God
Some say the high road is all I'll take
But not those on whom I've trod
I struggled a bit, other times I've quit
It's just part of who I am
But a friend in need is a friend indeed
And I always will do what I can

--Chorus--

Some say I have a quiet soul
Others say I speak to loud
Some say I've always been humble and meek
While some say I'm much too proud
I've played the fool 'til I'd seen it through
And it teaches me somehow to think
Sometimes a mans needs a gentle word
Often times, he needs a strong drink!

--Chorus--
--Chorus--
```
