C
Hey, hey, good lookin', Whatcha got cookin'?
D                   G7                C G7
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?

C
Hey, sweet baby, Don't you think maybe
         D         G7            C
We could find us a brand new recipe?


[Bridge]
        F                  C
I got a hot-rod Ford and a two-dollar bill
    F                   C
And I know a spot right over the hill.
F                        C
There's soda pop and the dancin's free,
          D                    G7
So if you wanna have fun come along with me.


Hey, good lookin', Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?


(Instrumental)

I'm free and ready, So we can go steady.
How's about savin' all your time for me?

No more lookin', I know I've been tooken
How's about keepin' steady company?


[Bridge]
          F                  C
I'm gonna throw my date-book over the fence
    F               C
And find me one for five or ten cents.
     F                 C
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
           D                         G7
'Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page.


Hey, good lookin', Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
