   G                   Em
As I came down through Dublin City
C      G       C         D
At the hour of twelve at night
G                        Em
Who should I see but the Spanish lady
C           G       C     D
Washing her feet by candlelight
G                      Em
First she washed them, then she dried them
G                    D______________
Over a fire of ambry coal
   G             Em
In all my life I ne'er did see
  C       G     C         D
A maid so sweet about the sole


￼Chorus:
G            (G/F#) Em
Whack for the toora loora laddy
C             G     C     D
Whack for the toora loora lay
G            (G/F#) Em
Whack for the toora loora laddy
C             G     C     D____________
Whack for the toora loora lay

I stopped to look but the watchman passed
Says he, "Young fellow, the night is late
Along with you home or I will wrestle you
Straight away through the Bridewell gate"
I blew a kiss to the Spanish lady
Hot as the fire of ambry coals
In all my life I never did see
A maid so sweet about the sole

--Chorus--

I’ve wandered North, and I have wonder South
Through Stoney Barter and Patrick's Close
Up and around, by the Gloucester Diamond
And back by Napper Tandy's house

[instantly slow, recitative]

Auld age has laid her hands on me
Cold as a fire of ashy coals....
But, where is the love of me Spanish Lady, a maid so sweet
about the soul

[still slow, quick speed up at final D chord]
--Chorus--

[original tempo]
--Chorus--

[original tempo, modified last line]
Whack for the toora loora laddy
Whack for the toora loora lay
Whack for the toora loora laddy
C/            G/       D/ G_________
Whack for the toora loora lay
