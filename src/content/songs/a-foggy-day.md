title: "A Foggy Day"
---

```
Foggy day in London town
Feelin low, feelin down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British museum had lost its charm

How long I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

(Trumpet solo, sax solo)

(Listen for break to come back in)

A foggy day in London town
Feelin low, feelin down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British museum had lost its charm

How long I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shi———-ning eve——-rywhere

(4 measures)
Shining everywhere
