```
                   G
Old songs and old stories
             D
they keep us alive
             C
Without our past,
                D
we would never survive
         G
I am my island,
             D
my island is me
         C
So you know what you can do
         D                 D
If you don’t like what you see


Chorus:
             G
Kiss me I’m Irish
              Em
I am the Wild Rover
                  C
My eyes they are smiling
                 D
And I’m seldom sober
              G
I like my whiskey
              Em
And I love to dance
                C
So if you’re feeling as lucky as me
          D
Take a chance…
                 G        D                     G
And kiss me I’m Irish,         My heart beats a jig

Verse
                      D
and me blood it flows green
               C
I’ve been a rogue and a rambler
              D
from ocean to sea
               G
And I like a ‘bevy’, now and then,
                D
that I’ll never deny
             C
But I only drink on the days of the week
                 D
that end with a ‘Y’
                        G
I’m no saint, I’m no sinner,
                   D
of that there’s no doubt.
                 C
I’ll tell ya the truth I am the one
           D                              D
That your grandmother warned you about!

Chorus:
            G
Kiss me I’m Irish
              Em
I am the Wild Rover
                  C
My eyes they are smiling
                 D
And I’m seldom sober
              G
I like my whiskey
              Em
And I love to dance
                C
So if you’re feeling as lucky as me
          D
Take a chance…
                 G             G
And kiss me I’m Irish

Bridge:
D                  D
Dublin, Milwaukee, Cleveland and Cork
D                C
Kerry, Chicago, Armagh and New York
D                   C
Belfast and Boston, Donegal and DC
C                                            D           D
Raise your glasses and sing, sing, sing with me!


Chorus x2:
            G
Kiss me I’m Irish
              Em
I am the Wild Rover
                  C
My eyes they are smiling
                 D
And I’m seldom sober
              G
I like my whiskey
              Em
And I love to dance
                C
So if you’re feeling as lucky as me
          D
Take a chance…
                 G             G
And kiss me I’m Irish
