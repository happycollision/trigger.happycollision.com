```
[Chorus]
I'll tell me ma, when I go home
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pulled my hair, and stole my comb
But that's all right when I go home
She is handsome she is pretty
She's the belle of Belfast City

--Instrumental--

[Verse]
Now Albert Mooney says he loves her
And all the boys are fighting for her
They're knocking at the door and they're ringing on the bell
Sayin' "Oh my true love, are you well?"
When she comes down white as snow
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
Old Johnny Murphy says he'll die
If she doesn't get a fella with a rovin' eye

--Chorus--
--Instrumental--

Let the wind and the rain and the hail come by
Let the snow come shovelin' from the sky
She's as sweet as apple pie
She'll get her own love by and by
When she gets a lad of her own
She won't tell her ma when she goes home
Let them all come as they will,
It's Patrick Dunham she loves still

--Chorus--

--Instrumental--

--Chorus--
--Chorus--
