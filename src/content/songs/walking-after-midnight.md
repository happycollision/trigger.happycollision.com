[Intro]
C

[Verse 1]
     C
I go out walking after midnight
           F                              C
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
          C              Ab       G            C  F  C  G
I'm always walking after midnight searching for you

[Verse 2]
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of saying I love you
I'm always walking after midnight searching for you

[Bridge]
          F
I stopped to see a weeping willow
                      C
Crying on his pillow, maybe he's crying for me
    F
And as the skies turn gloomy
                               C               G
Night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be

[Verse 3]
I go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just hoping you may be
Somewhere a-walking after midnight searching for me

[Bridge]
I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow, maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be

[Verse 4]
I go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just hoping you may be
Somewhere a-walking after midnight searching for me
