Chorus:
C              G               C                  F
Come on all me hearties, we’ll roam the mountains high
C                F           C        G       C
Together we will plunder and together we will die
We’ll Wander o’er the valleys, we’ll gallop o’er the plain
With scorn to live in slavery, bound down in iron n' chains!


     C            G               F             C
It's of a wild colonial boy, Jack Dolan was his name,
   C               F              C       G     C
Of poor but honest parents he was born in Castlemain.
He was his father's only hope, his mother's only joy,
And dearly did his parents love their wild colonial boy.

At scarcely eighteen years of age he left his father’s home,
All through Australia’s sunny clim(ate) a stranger he did roam.
He robbed those wealthy squatters and their stock he did destroy,
A terror to Australia was the wild colonial boy.

--Chorus--

In sixty-one this daring youth commenced his wild career,
With a heart that knew no danger, not a full man did he fear.
Held up the Beechworth mail-coach and he robbed Judge MacEvoy,
Who trembled and gave up his gold to the wild colonial boy.

One day as he was rambling the mountainside along,
Listening to those little birds, their pleasant laughing song
He saw three mounted troopers, Kelly, Davis, and Fitzroy,
Who swore that they would capture him, the wild colonial boy.

--Chorus--

“Surrender now, Jack Dolan, for you see we're three to one
Surrender now, Jack Dolan, or your life will not be long.”
Jack pulled a pistol from his belt and shook it up on high
“I'll fight but not surrender,” said the wild colonial boy.

He fired at Trooper Kelly and he brought him to the ground,
Then turning round to Davis he received a mortal wound
All shattered through the jaw he lay, still firing at Fitzroy,
And that's the way they captured him, the wild colonial boy.

--Chorus--
