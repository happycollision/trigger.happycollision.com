[Intro]
A  A/E  x4

[Verse 1]
A              F#m            E                       D          A
  Almost Heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
A                    F#m                   E                           D
  Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, growin'
         A
like a breeze.

[Chorus]
        A              E            F#m       D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
        A               E             D             A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Verse 2]
A               F#m                E               D                A
 All my memories  gather 'round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
A                 F#m                 E                         D              A
  Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

[Chorus]
        A              E            F#m       D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
        A               E             D             A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Bridge]
F#m         E/G#          A
 I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me.
    D       A              E
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    F#m              G            D              A
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin' that I should have been home
E                E7
yesterday, yesterday.

[Chorus]
        A              E            F#m       D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
        A               E             D             A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

        A              E            F#m       D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
        A               E             D             A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Outro]
        E                    A
Take me home, (down) country roads.
        E                    A
Take me home, (down) country roads.
