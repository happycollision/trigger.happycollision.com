title: Do I Ever Cross Your Mind
---

```
[Intro]
C
  Mmm mm mm mm-mm
C
  Mmm mm mm mm-mm
C
  Mmm mm mm mm-mm
C           C
        Oh hoh


[Verse 1]
        C
Oh, sometimes I go walkin' through fields where we walked
      F                       C
Long ago in the sweet used to be
        C
And the flowers still grow but they don't smell as sweet
        C            G               C
As they did when you picked them for me


[Chorus]
         Am         C           Am
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
C     F                        C
How I wish we could go back in time
       C
Do you   ever think back on old mem'ries like that
     C       G          C
Or do I ever cross your mind?


[Bridge]
       F
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you
C
Miss me, do you Darling?
        G                              F                           C
Oh, and do your mem'ries ever take you back into another place and time?
        F
Oh, and do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared when you were
C
With me, do you Darling?
       C           G          C
I just wonder do I cross your mind?


[Instrumental]
| C   | C   | F   | C   |
| C   | C   | C G | C   |


[Verse 2]
        C
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
           F                     C
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
        C
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms
          C          G          C
That once held me so gentle and close


[Chorus]
         Am         C           Am
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
C     F                        C
How I wish we could go back in time (go back in time)
       C
Do you   ever recall these old mem'ries at all
     C       G          C
Or do I ever cross your mind?


[Bridge]
       F
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you
C
Miss me, do you Darling?
        G                              F                           C
Oh, and do your mem'ries ever take you back into another place and time?
        F
Oh, and do you ever miss the feelin's and the love we shared when you were
C
With me, do you Darling?
       C           G          Am   F
I just wonder do I cross your mind?
       C      G          C
Oh, do I ever cross your mind?


[Outro]
C
  Mmm mm mm mm-mm
C
  Mmm mm mm mm-mm
C
  Mmm mm mm mm-mm
C
      Oh oh oh, tell me
C
  Do I ever, do I?  Do I ever, do I?  Do I ever cross your mind?
C
      Oh hoh, Darlin'
C
  Do I ever, do I?  Do I ever, do I?  Do I ever cross your mind?
