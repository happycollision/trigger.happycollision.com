title: Can't Cry Anymore
---

```
I took your car
And drove to Texas
Sorry, honey
But I suspected we were through
And I can't cry anymore

Since I left
Been feelin' better
'Cause, that's what you get
When you, ya stay together too long
And I can't cry anymore

Wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere
Well so long to this life
Well, so much for pretendin'
'Cause bad luck's never-endin'
And now I know that

Money comes in
But the fact is
There's not enough to
Pay my taxes
And I, I can't cry anymore

Well, I got a brother
He's got real problems
Heroin, and now there's just no stoppin' him tonight
And I won't cry anymore

Well wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere?
Well so long to this life
So much for pretendin'
'Cause bad luck's never-endin'
It's never-endin'
Oh-ooh-oh oh-oh
Yeah

Solo

Well, it could be worse
I could've missed my callin'
Sometimes it hurts
But, when you read the writin' on the wall
You can't cry anymore

Well wouldn't it be nice if we could hop a flight to anywhere?
Well so long to this life
So much for pretendin'
'Cause bad luck's never-endin'
And too much time I've been spendin'
With my, heart in my hands
Waitin' for time to come and mend it

I can't cry anymore
I can't cry anymore
I can't cry anymore
I can't cry anymore
I can't cry anymore

(Walk away from the mic)
