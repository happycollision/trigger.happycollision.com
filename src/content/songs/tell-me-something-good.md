title: "Tell Me Something Good"
---

```
You ain't got no kind of feeling inside 
I got something that'll sho' 'nuff set your stuff on fire 
You refuse to put anything before your pride 
What I got will knock all your pride aside

Tell me something good 
Tell me that you love me, yeah 
Tell me something good 
Tell me that you like it, yeah

Got no time is what you're known to say 
(Got no time, no, got no time) 
I'll make you wish there was 48 hours to each day 
Your problem is you ain't been loved like you should 
But what I got to give will sho' 'nuff do you good

Tell me something good 
(Tell me, tell me, tell me) 
Tell me that you love me, yeah 
Tell me something good 
(Tell me, tell me, tell me) 
Tell me that you like it, yeah

You ain't got no kind of feeling inside 
I got something that'll sho' 'nuff set your stuff on fire 
You refuse to put anything before your pride 
What I got will knock your pride aside

Tell me something good (oh, yeah, yeah) 
Tell me that you love me, yeah 
Tell me something good 
(Oh, baby, baby, baby, yeah) 
Tell me that you like it, yeah (you got to)

Tell me something good 
(Oh, oh, tell me, baby, tell me) 
Tell me that you love me, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Tell me something good 
(Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me) 
Tell me that you like it, yeah, yeah 
(Don't you like it baby?) 
Tell me something good
