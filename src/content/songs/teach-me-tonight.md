title: Teach Me Tonight
---

```
Did you say I've got a lot to learn?
Well, don't think I'm tryin' not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Ooh, teach me tonight

Starting with the A B C of it
Roll right down to the X Y Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a black board
High above you
When a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight
