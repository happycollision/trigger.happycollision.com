title: Santa Claus is Coming to Town
---

```
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I’m telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He’s making a list,
Checking it twice,
Gonna find out who’s naughty or nice.
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you’re sleeping
He knows when you’re awake
He knows when you’ve been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I’m telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

Oh, You better watch out
You better not cry

Santa Claus is coming to town

He’s making a list,

Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you’re sleeping

He knows when you’ve been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, You better watch out
You better not cry

I’m telling you why
Santa Claus is coming (band 2 measures)
Santa Claus is coming to town
