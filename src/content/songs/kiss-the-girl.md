title: Kiss the Girl

```
Percussions
Strings
Winds
Words

There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her

And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You want to kiss the girl

Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she wants you, too
There is one way to ask her

It don't take a word
Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl
Sing with me now

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
My, oh, my
Look at the boy too shy
He ain't gonna kiss the girl

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Ain't that sad?
Ain't it a shame? Too bad
You gonna miss the girl

Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until ya kiss the girl

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't stop now
Don't try to hide it how
You wanna kiss the girl

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Float along
And listen to the song
The song say: "Kiss the girl"

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Music play
Do what the music say
You gotta kiss the girl

You've got to kiss the girl
Why don't you kiss the girl
You wanna kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl
You've got to kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl
