```
[Verse 1]
Wise men say
"Only fools rush in"
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Verse 2]
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help
Falling in love with you?

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

[Verse 3]
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
See upcoming pop shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists
You might also like

[Outro]
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you
For I can't help
Falling in love with you
