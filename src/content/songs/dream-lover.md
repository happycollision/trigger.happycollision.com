[Verse 1]
C                            Am
Every night I hope and pray, a dream lover will come my way
C                             Am
A girl to hold in my arms and know the magic of her charms

[Chorus]
          C      G7      C       F
Because I want a girl to call my own
        C      Am       F              G       C     G7
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone.


[Verse 2]
Dream lover, where are you - with a love oh so true,
And a hand that I can hold, to feel you near when I grow old?

[ref: chorus: end on C7]


[Bridge]
F
  Someday, I don't know how
C
  I hope she'll hear my plea
D7
   Some way, I don't know how
G7 N.C.             G7
   She'll bring her love to me


[Verse 3]
Dream lover, until then, I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do, until my lover's dreams come true

[ref: chorus]


[Verse 4]
Dream lover, until then, I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do, until my lover's dreams come true

[ref: chorus, then repeat next line:]

        C      Am       F              G       C
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone.
