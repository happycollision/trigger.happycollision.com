        F
I got a feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, Lord
                       C7
Since my baby said goodbye
                             C7
Lord, I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo
                    F N.C.        F
All I do is sit and sigh-igh, oh, Lord


     F7        Bb               Bb6
That last long day she said goodbye
     F                       D7
Well Lord, I thought I would cry
       G7
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'
C7
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me
      F N.C.    F                    C7
Sweet dad-ad-ad-dy, such a beautiful dream
                       C7
I hate to think it all o-o-ver
                      A
I've lost my heart it seems


              Bb              Bb6
I've grown so used to you somehow
          F              D7
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
        G7             C7
And I'm lo-on-onesome
                   F
I got the lovesick blues


             A                        Dm
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
A                              Dm
  That's what's the matter with me
             A                        Dm
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
    G7                   C7
But she don't care about me


        C7
Lord, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied
    F7
But she just wouldn't stay
   G7
So now that she is lea-ea-vin'
                  C7
This is all I can say


        F
I got a feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, Lord

And I'm lo-on-onesome
                   F
I got the lovesick blu-ues
