Home for the Holidays

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays,
'Cause no matter how far away you roam,
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze,
For the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home.

I met a man who lives in Tennessee,
He was headin' for,
Pennsylvania, and some home made pumpkin pie.
From Pennsylvania, folks are travelin'
Down to Dixie's sunny shore,
From Atlantic to Pacific,
Gee, the traffic is terrific.

Oh there's no place like home for the holidays,
'Cause no matter how far away you roam,
If you want to be happy in a million ways,
For the holidays,
You can't beat home, sweet home.


I'll be home for Christmas You can plan on me Please have snow and mistletoe And presents neath the tree

Christmas eve will find me Where the love light gleams I'll be home for Christmas If only in my dreams

Christmas eve will find me Right where the love light gleams And I'll be home for Christmas If only in my dreams If only in my dreams
