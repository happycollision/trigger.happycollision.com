[Intro]

A A#dim7 Bm E7
A A#dim7 Bm E7

[Verse]

           A          A#dim7
There were bells on a hill
      Bm               Dm
But I never heard them ringing
     A     C#m           Bm
No I never heard them at all
E              A Bm  E E7
Till there was you

           A            A#dim7
There were birds in the sky
      Bm             Dm
But I never saw them winging
     A     C#m         Bm
No I never saw them at all
E              A  A7
Till there was you

[Pre-Chorus]

               D         Dm       A
Then there was music, and wonderful roses
     F#7         Bm             B7         E         E7
They tell me, in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn, and you

[Chorus]

          A          A#dim7
There was love, all around
      Bm             Dm
But I never heard it singing
     A     C#m         Bm
No I never heard it at all
E              A  Bm E E7
Till there was you

[Pre-Chorus]

               D         Dm       A
Then there was music, and wonderful roses
     F#7         Bm             B7         E        E7
They tell me, in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you

[Chorus]

          A          A#dim7
There was love, all around
      Bm             Dm
But I never heard it singing
     A     C#m         Bm
No I never heard it at all,
E              A
Till there was you
