title: I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair
---

```
I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
And send him on his way

I'm gonna wave that man right outta my arms
I'm gonna wave that man right outta my arms
I'm gonna wave that man right outta my arms
And send him on his way

Don't try to patch it up
Tear it up, tear it up
Wash him out, dry him out
Push him out, fly him out
Cancel him and let him go

Yea, sister!

I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
And send him on his way

A Bushel and a Peck
Doris Day
I love you, a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck and a hug around the neck
A hug around the neck and a barrel and a heap
A barrel and a heap and I'm talkin' in my sleep

About you, about you
'Cause I love you, a bushel and a peck
You bet your purdy neck, I do
A doodle oodle, ooh doo
A doodle oodle, oodle, ooh doo

I love you, a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck and it beats me all to heck
It beats me all to heck, how I'll ever tend the farm
Ever tend the farm when I wanna keep my arm

About you, about you
'Cause I love you, a bushel and a peck
You bet your purdy neck, I do
A doodle oodle, ooh doo
A doodle oodle, oodle, ooh doo
