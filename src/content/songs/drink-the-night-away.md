Chorus:
G          C          G
Weigh-hey! Hey Laddie Hey!
G                      D               G
Weigh, hey, hey! We'll drink the night away!


G
We set sail at half-past morn,
D             C
looking for a new tomorrow,
G
don't know when we're coming home,
         D                                 C
so we'll drink, and we'll dance, and we'll drown our sorrow!


Now, I don't know what there lies in store,
but it's better than this that's why I'm willing,
To stake my claim on a foreign shore,
whit me spoons, and me fiddle, and half a shlling!

--Chorus--

I dreamt a place, I know it's true
where the dolphins play and it's always sunny.
The girls are brown and the ocean blue,
less work to do, but you make more money!

--Chorus--

I must be off by morning's light,
I can hear our bo'sun's whistle blowing,
so itâ€™s one more kiss, and one more fight,
and one more song while the beer is flowing!

--Chorus--

         G                 Bm     D
When the sky is grey, look out to sea.
         G                      C        Am
When the waves are high and the light is dying,
     G                 Bm       D
well raise a glass and think of me...
         C/
When I'm home again, boys, I'll be buying!

--Chorus----Chorus--

--Chorus a cappella--

--Chorus--
