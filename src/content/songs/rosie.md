[Intro]
G D G D G
 
[Verse 1]
     Em                      Bm
Now Rosie, You're losin' the spot, love; 
    C                           G
The light used to shine in your eye.
     Em                          Bm
Now, tell me you haven't stopped dreamin' 
     C                           G
That you still reach out for the sky 
    Em                        Bm
For this life, it's no bed of roses, 
     C                          G
It's not all it's cracked up to be 
    Am                                D7
But in the end there's always you and me...
 
[Chorus]
G            D
Rosie, sweet Rosie 
G                   D
Money don't grow on trees 
         G                     D
But if I thought for just one second it did 
       G          D      G
I'd be down on my bended knee 
 
[Verse 2]
    Em                       Bm
Now we'll take our tea and a lemon, 
  C                          G
A match that was made in the Heaven 
    Em                     Bm
Two lovers that walk in on this town 
   C                      G
We don't need a ball or a gown.
    Em                       Bm
Now tell your dear Ma not to worry, 
    C                           G
You won't need for nothing with me 
    Am                             D7
Now let the rivers run down to the sea.
 
[Chorus]
G            D
Rosie, sweet Rosie, 
G                   D
Money don't grow on trees 
         G                    D
But if I thought for just one second it did 
G                 D      G
I'd be down on my bended knee
 
[Bridge]
    Em         D      C
I'm down on my bended knee, 
   Em               D               G
So you'd spend your whole life with me 
   Am                Em
Until the day, it'll be okay 
       D
You'll see, you'll see

[Chorus]
N.C.
Rosie, sweet Rosie,
 
Money don't grow on trees
         G                    D
But if I thought for just one second it did 
       G          D      G
I'd be down on my bended knee 
         G                    D
But if I thought for just one second it did 
       G          D      G
I'd be down on my bended knee 
             G          D      G
Yeah, I'd be down on my bended knee!
