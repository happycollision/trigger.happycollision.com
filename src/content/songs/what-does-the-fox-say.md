Capo 2


[INTRO]

Bm A E


[VERSE 1]

Bm            A              E
     Dog goes woof, cat goes meow,
                                Bm
Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeek.
         A              E
Cow goes moo, frog goes croak,
                           Bm
And the elephant goes toot.
                 A                  E
Ducks says quack,  And fish go blub
And the seal goes ow ow ow
Bm
     But there's one sound
A                    E
     that no one knows
What does the fox say?

[VERSE 2]

Bm            A            E
     Big blue eyes, pointy nose,
                         Bm
Chasing mice and digging holes,
     A            E
Tiny paws, up the hill,
                               Bm
Suddenly you're standing still,
                A             E
Your fur is red, so beautiful,
                          Bm
Like an angel in disguise,
               A                 E
But if you meet a friendly horse,
Will you communicate by
Bm            A
mo-o-o-o-orse? Mo-o-o-o-orse?
E
Mo-o-o-o-orse?
How will you speak to that
Bm            A
ho-o-o-o-orse? Ho-o-o-o-orse?
E
Ho-o-o-o-orse?

What does the fox say?
