We don't do the George Michel lyrics anymore

```
        Em                     G      D
Near to Banbridge Town, in the County Down
    Em           D
One morning in July,
       Em                  G       D
Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen,
        Em            Am        Em
And she smiled as she passed me by;
        G                       D
Oh, she looked so neat from her two white feet
       Em       Am            D
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair,
         Em               G          D
Sure the coaxing elf, I'd to shake myself
   Em              Am       Em
To make sure I was standing there

[Chorus]
         G                D
Oh, from Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay,
         Em              D
And from Galway to Dublin town,
   Em                      G        D
No maid I've seen like the sweet colleen
       Em         Am     Em
That I met in the County Down.

As she onward sped I shook my head
And I gazed with a feeling quare,
And I said, says I, to a passer-by,
"Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?"
Oh, he smiled at me, and with pride says he,
"That's the gem of Ireland's crown,
She's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,
She's the Star of the County Down."

--Chorus--

She'd a soft, brown eye, and a look so sly
And a smile like a rose in June
And you held each note from her lillywhite throat
As she lilted an Irish tune
At the pattern dance, you'll be in a trance
As she'd trip through a jig or reel
When her eyes she'd roll, she would soothe the soul
And your heart she would likely steal

--Chorus--

At the crossroads fair she'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my hat cocked right and my shoes shone bright
For a smile from the nut-brown Rose.
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Though with rust my plow turns brown,
Till a smiling bride by my own fireside
Sits the Star of the County Down.

--Chorus--
--Chorus--

[Other verses to choose from]

I've travelled a bit, but never was hit
Since my roving career began;
But fair and square I surrendered there
To the charms of young Rose McCann.
I'd a heart to let and no tenant yet
Did I meet with in shawl or gown,
But in she went and I asked no rent
>From the Star of the County Down.
