title: I Got Rhythm
---

```
[Verse]
Days can be sunny
With never a sigh
Don't need what money
Can buy
Birds in the trees sing
Their dayful of song
Why shouldn't we sing
Along?
I'm chipper all the day
Happy with my lot
How do I get that way?
Look at what I've got

[Chorus]
I got rhythm
I got music
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
In green pastures
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
And Old Man Trouble
Say, I don't mind him
Course you won't find him
'Round my door
I got starlight
And I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Ah
Who could ask for anything more?
Ah
Who could ask for anything more?
Old Man Trouble
Say, I don't mind him
'Course you won't find him
Hangin' 'round my front or back door
Ah
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
