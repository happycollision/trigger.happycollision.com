Dm
A drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm
C
A drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm
Dm
A drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm
Dm        C           Dm
And we'll all hang on behind.

So we'll roll the golden chariot along
An' we'll roll the golden chariot along.
So we'll roll the golden chariot along
An' we'll all hang on behind!

A plate of Irish stew wouldn't do us any harm...

A nice fat cook wouldn't do us any harm...

A night with the girls wouldn't do us any harm...

A roll in the clover wouldn't do us any harm...

A shot of whiskey wouldn't do us any harm...

A round on the house wouldn't do us any harm...

A drop of Nelson's Blood wouldn't do us any harm...
