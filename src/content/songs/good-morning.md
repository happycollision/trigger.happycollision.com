title: Good Morning

```
Good mornin'
Good mornin', we've talked the whole night through
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

Good mornin', good mornin'
It's great to stay up late
Good mornin', good mornin' to you

When the band began to play, the stars were shinin' bright
Now the milkman's on his way, it's too late to say goodnight

So, good mornin', good mornin', sunbeams will soon smile through
Good mornin', good mornin' to you
And you, and you, and you
```
