[Verse]
        F            C
Now, my name is Jock Stewart
      F          Bb
I'm a canny gaun man
      F            C           F     C
And a roving young fellow I've been

[Chorus]
      F        C
So be easy and free
            F            Bb
When you're drinkin' wi' me
      F             C          F    C
I'm a man you don't meet every day

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I have acres of land
I have men at command
I have always a shilling to spare

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Now, I took out my gun
With my dog I did shoot
All down by the River Kildare

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
So, come fill up your glasses
Of brandy and wine
And whatever the cost, I will pay

[Chorus]

[Outro]
F  Bb  F  C
