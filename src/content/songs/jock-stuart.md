[Intro]

C  F  C  G

[Verse]
        C            G
Now, my name is Jock Stewart
      C          F
I'm a canny gaun man
      C            F           C     G
And a roving young fellow I've been

[Chorus]
      C        G
So be easy and free
            C            F
When you're drinkin' wi' me
      C             F          C    G
I'm a man you don't meet every day

[Instrumental]
C  F  C  G
C  F  C  G

[Verse]
I have acres of land
I have men at command
I have always a shilling to spare

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Now, I took out my gun
With my dog I did shoot
All down by the River Kildare

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
So, come fill up your glasses
Of brandy and wine
And whatever the cost, I will pay

[Chorus]

[Outro]
C  F  C  G
