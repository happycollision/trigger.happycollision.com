title: On My Own

```
On my own,
Pretending he's beside me.
All alone,
I walk with him 'til morning.
Without him,
I feel his arms around me.
And when i lose my way i close my eyes
And he has found me.

In the rain,
The pavement shines like silver.
All the lights are misty in the river.
In the darkness,
The trees are full of starlight.
And all i see is him and me for ever and forever.

And i know
It's only in my mind,
That i'm talking to myself
And not to him.
And although i know that he is blind,
Still i say,
There's a way for us.

I love him,
But when the night is over he is gone.
The river's just a river.
Without him,
The world around me changes.
The trees are bare and everywhere
The streets are full of strangers.

I love him,
But every day i'm learning
All my life,
I've only been pretending!
Without me,
His world will go on turning,
A world that's full of happiness that i have never known!

I love him...
I love him...
I love him...
But only on my own...
