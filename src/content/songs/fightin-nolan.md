[Intro]
D  G  D  A
D  G  D  A


[Verse 1]
         D                             G
Have you seen Fightin' Nolan, Fightin' Nolan Kennedy?
   D                                   A
He fought his way from Belfast all the way to the prairie
       D                          G
He's a rouge and a rambler with a powerful thirst
   D                                A
He loves to court the fellas but he drinks his whiskey first

[Chorus]
So raise em up, raise em up, here's to you and me
Here's a toast for all the lads in the company
Now drink em down, drink em down, next one's on me
      D                           G                 A         D
We're gonna paint this town red before we cross the sea

[Verse 2]
Now Fightin' Nolan is a small, mountain of a man
He fought and killed a lion with his bare hands
He's a joker and a braggart and he's tough as nails
And before he starts his day he drinks a cask full of ale


[Chorus]


And Fightin' Nolan is wanted by the ladies and the law
He's the smartest, toughest, bravest man that you ever saw
He was marked for execution to be buried in the sand
Til he helped St. Patrick drive the snakes out of Ireland

[Chorus]

[Chorus, slow down at altered final line:]
And here's one final toast to our friend Nolan Kennedy
