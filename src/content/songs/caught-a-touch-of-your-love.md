title: Caught a Touch of Your Love
---

```
I'm not feeling like I usually do
I think it might be something to so with you;
Every time you're near me my body gets hot
Don't need no doctor, I know what I got!

I caught a touch of your love
It came on overnight
I must have held you too tight
Last night I caught a touch of your love

Your affection has affected me
Feeling kind o' dizzy and weak in the knees
I've been in love before but never so bad
You're in my system and it's driving' me mad

I caught a touch of your love
It came on overnight
I must have held you too tight
Last night I caught a touch of your love

The feel from your kisses tears me apart
It starts from your lips and goes straight to my heart
No use pretending 'cause baby I'm sure
There's no cure and I've just got to have more
More, more, more, more!
```
