[Intro]
D  G  D  A
D  G  D  A

[Verse]
        D            A
Now, my name is Jock Stewart
      D          G
I'm a canny gaun man
      D            A           D     A
And a roving young fellow I've been

[Chorus]
      D        A
So be easy and free
            D            G
When you're drinkin' wi' me
      D             A          D    A
I'm a man you don't meet every day

[Instrumental]
D  G  D  A
D  G  D  A

[Verse]
I have acres of land
I have men at command
I have always a shilling to spare

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Now, I took out my gun
With my dog I did shoot
All down by the River Kildare

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
So, come fill up your glasses
Of brandy and wine
And whatever the cost, I will pay

[Chorus]

[Outro]
D  G  D  A
D  G  D  A
