[Verse 1]
       Dm                                C
I was born on a Dublin street where the Royal drums do beat
         Dm
And the loving English feet they walked all over us
      F                                   C       Am
And every single night when me da would come home tight
       Dm                 C                  Dm
He'd invite the neighbors outside with this chorus



[Chorus]
         Dm
Oh, come out you black and tans
             C
Come out and fight me like a man
           Dm
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
           F                     C            Am
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away
           Dm              C            Dm
From the green and lovely lanes in Killashandra



[Verse 2]
Come let me hear you tell
How you slandered great Parnell
When you thought him well and truly persecuted
Where are the sneers and jeers
That you loudly let us hear
When our heroes of sixteen were executed


[Chorus]


[Verse 3]
Come tell us how you slew
Those ol' Arabs two by two
Like the Zulus they had spears and bows and arrows
How you bravely faced one
With your sixteen pounder gun
And you frightened them poor natives to their marrow



[Chorus]


[Verse 4]
Now the time is coming fast
And I think them days are here
When each English yeoman he will run before us
And if there be a need
Then our kids will say, "Godspeed!"
With a verse or two of singing this fine chorus


[Chorus]
[Chorus]
