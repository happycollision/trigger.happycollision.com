I've changed all the C# to Bm, as I am pretty sure that is what is actually
going on. You can also use Em (or G) to transitions between D and C or from C to
D pretty much every time it happens. Especially when there is a strong emphasis
on that passing note.

```
[Chorus - a capella]
Oh Maggie, give me one more chance,
I swear I’ll make everything right.
Oh Maggie, can I have this dance?
                Build......D.......G
Please stay ay ay ay, tonight

[Verse 1]
D            Em              C    G     D
Walking down broadway in the blinding   light
            Em            G
The city is ringing in my ears
D         Em             C   G      D           C
Trying to work out how a few months turned into years
D               Em                C  G  D
She cradles the young ones by the fireside
           Em           G
Smoldering embers among tears
D              Em                 C   G      D          C
Collects a few bar bites and each fortnight, I'm in her ears.
        D
And she fears, and I say.


[Chorus]
C     G               D   G    C
   Oh Maggie, give me one more chance,
             G               Bm
I swear I’ll make everything right.
C     G             D    G    C
   Oh Maggie, can I have this dance?
                  D      G
Please stay ay ay ay, tonight

[Verse 2]
D           Em             C       D
Millions of people on this crowded street
           Em          G
I've never felt so all alone
D          Em         C          D          C
Longing to see her is all that's keeping me going
D          Em             C     D
Maggie, if only you would understand
      Em               G
Being apart can set us free
D               Em            C    D                C
Its just taking longer than I ever thought it would be
   D
Oh believe me, when I say

[Chorus]
C     G               D   G    C
   Oh Maggie, give me one more chance,
             G               Bm
I swear I’ll make everything right.
C     G             D    G    C
