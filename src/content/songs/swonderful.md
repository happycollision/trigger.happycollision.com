```
's wonderful, 's marvellous
You should care for me!
's awful nice, 's paradise,
's what I love to see.

You've made my life so glamorous,
You can't blame me for feeling amorous!
Oh 's wonderful, 's marvellous,
That you should care for me!

's wonderful, 's marvellous
You should care for me!
's awful nice, 's paradise,
's what I love to see.

My dear it's four-leaf clover time;
From now on my heart is working overtime.
Oh, 's wonderful! 's marvellous
That you should care for me!
