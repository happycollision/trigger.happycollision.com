G                 C
Whiskey, Whiskey, Nancy Whiskey
G                 D
Whiskey, Whiskey, Nancy-O
G               C
I've got silver in me pocket
G                     D
And I'll follow where e'er you go

I'm a weaver, a Calton weaver, I'm a rash and a roving blade
I've got silver in my pockets and I follow the roving trade

As I went down through Glasgow City, Nancy Whiskey I chanced to smell
I went in, sat down beside her, seven long years I loved her well

The more I kissed her, the more I loved her, the more I kissed her, the more she smiled
Soon I forgot my mother's teaching, Nancy soon had me beguiled

Now, I rose early in the morning, to slake my thirst, it was my need
I tried to rise but I was not able, Nancy had me by the knees

So I'm going back to the Calton weaving, I'll surely make them shuttles fly
For I'll make more at the Calton weaving than ever I did in the roving way

So come all you weavers, you Calton weavers, come all you weavers, where e'er you be
Beware of Whiskey, Nancy Whiskey, she'll ruin you like she ruined me
