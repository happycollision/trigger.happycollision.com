```
If I can reach the stars, pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart so you could see the truth
That this love I have inside is everything it seems
But for now I find, it's only in my dreams

And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world

If I could be king, even for a day
I'd take you as my queen, I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule in this kingdom we have made
'Til then, I'd be a fool wishing for the day

And I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world
Baby, if I could change the world

I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world
Baby, if I could change the world
Baby, if I could change the world
```
