```
                     D
I’ve been down on my luck
          G          D
Been down   too long this time
     G               D
I’ve drank em to the bottom
      A
Til I found myself there too
        G
And the taste of defeat
    D             A
Has never been so sweet
     G
So I pour another glass
     D    A    D
Fail again and again

I've been down
And I’ve been higher than Sears Tower
I asked the higher powers
If they could just spare a drink
Did they answer my cries?
I was a bit preoccupied
I toasted them boasted to them
That they had met their match

Chorus:
       D                G              D
But as long as there is whiskey in the world
       D              G
We can drink away the heartache
       D              A
We can drink away the girls
       D                   G     D
Who we long to love but we never touch
   D                A              D
As long as there is whiskey in the world
  

I have loved
And I've lost all that they gave me
They all try to save me
But I'm seeing this thing through
And these feelings of remorse
They leave me no recourse
So I pour another glass
Fail again and again


--Chorus--


Bridge:

A                 D
I DONT WANT TO BE SAVED
(Speed up)


--Chorus--


As long as there is whiskey in the world
As long as there is whiskey in the world
As long as there is whiskey
As long as there is whiskey
As long as there is whiskey in the world
```
