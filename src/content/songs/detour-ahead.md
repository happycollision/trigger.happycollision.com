title: Detour Ahead
---

```
Smooth road, clear day
But why am I the only one travelin' this way?
How strange--the road to love should be so easy
Can't you see the detour ahead?

Wake up, slow down
Before you crash and break your heart, gullible clown
You fool, you're headed in the wrong direction
Can't you see the detour ahead?

The further you travel, the harder to unravel the web
She spins around you
Turn back while there's time
Don't you see the danger sign?
Soft shoulders surround you

Smooth road, clear night
Oh, lucky me that suddenly I saw the light
I'm turning back away from all that sorrow
Smooth road, clear day
No detour ahead

The further you travel, the harder to unravel the web
She spins around you
Turn back while there's time
Don't you see the danger sign?
Soft shoulders surround you
See upcoming pop shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists

Smooth road, clear night
Oh, lucky me that suddenly I saw the light
I'm turning back away from all that sorrow
Smooth road, clear day
No detour ahead
