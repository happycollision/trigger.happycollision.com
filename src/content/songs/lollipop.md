[Chorus]
G         Em            Am    D
Lollipop, Lollipop, oh, Lolli, Lolli, Lolli..
G         Em            Am    D
Lollipop, Lollipop..oh, Lolli, Lolli, Lolli..
G         Em            Am    D
Lollipop, Lollipop..oh, Lolli, Lolli, Lolli..
G
LOLLIPOP!..


[Verse 1]
G            C         G        C
Call my baby Lollipop..tell you why.
G           C             Am     D
His kiss is sweeter than an apple pie.
G           C              G       C
And when he does his shaky rockin' dance,
G              D     G
Man, I haven't got a chance...


  D
I call him...

[ref:Chorus]


[Bridge]
C                              G            C         G
Sweeter than candy on a stick, Huckleberry, Cherry or Lime.
C                                           D
If you had a choice, he'd be your pick, but Lollipop is mi..i..ine.


[ref:Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Crazy way he thrills me..tell you why..
Just like a lightning from the sky.
He loves to kiss me, till I can't see straight.
Gee, my Lollipop is great.


  D
I call him...

[ref:Chorus x 2]
