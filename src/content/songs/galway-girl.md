[Intro]

D D


[Verse 1]

D
Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
     D      A    G
On a day -I-ay-I-ay
D
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
     D         G      D
On a fine soft day -I-ay
      G          D               G        D
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
            Bm      A             G         D
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
        G         D           G         D
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl
            Bm                   G      D
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

[Verse 2]

D
We were halfway there when the rain came down
                 G
On a day -I-ay-I-ay
        D
And she asked me up to her flat downtown
     D          G          D
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay
      G        D                G        D
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
            Bm      A             G         D
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
      G        D          G          D
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl
       Bm                G      D
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

[Verse 3]

D                                G
When I woke up I was all alone
         D                              G  D
With a broken heart and a ticket home
      G        D            G             D
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do
        Bm         A          G          D
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
            G        D                     G         D
'Cause I've traveled around. I've been all over this world
              Bm        A              G      D
Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl
