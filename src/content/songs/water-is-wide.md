(G)          G     C              G
The water is wide,   I cannot get o'er;
    G/F#         Em   Am         D7
And neither have I      wings to fly;
          Em    C          C/B   G   G/F#   Em
Give me a boat    that can carry two,
               Dsus  D7            G
And both shall row,    my love and I.


(Repeat G until singer starts each verse)


There is a ship and she sails the sea;
She's loaded deep as deep can be;
But not so deep as the love I'm in:
I know not how I sink or swim.


I leaned my back up against an oak.
I thought it was a trusty tree.
But first it swayed, and then it broke,
So did my love prove false to me.


O, love is handsome, and love is fine.
And love is charming when it is true.
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like morning dew.


The water is wide,   I cannot get o'er;
And neither have I      wings to fly;
Give me a boat    that can carry two,
And both shall row,    my love and I.
And both shall row, my love and I
