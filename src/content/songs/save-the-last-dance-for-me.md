[Verse 1]
        D
You can dance every dance with the guy who gives you the eye
        A
Let him hold you tight.
          A
You can smile every smile for the man who held your hand
           D                D7
'Neath the pale moonlight.

[Chorus]
          G
But Don't forget who's taking you home
                         D
And in whose arms you're gonna be.
   A                  A7            D
So darling, save the last dance for me.

[Verse 2]
     D
Oh I know that the music is fine like sparkling wine
       A
Go and have your fun.
          A
Laugh and sing but while we're apart
                         D        D7
Don't give your heart to anyone.

[Chorus]
          G
But Don't forget who's taking you home
                         D
And in whose arms you're gonna be.
   A                  A7            D
So darling, save the last dance for me.

[Bridge]
D                     A
Baby don't you know I love you so
                          D
Can't you feel it when we touch.
                   A
I will never never let you go
                        D
'Cause I love you oh so much.

[Verse 3]
         D
You can dance, go and carry on
                                A
Till the night is gone and it's time to go.
      A
If he asks if you're all alone can he take you home
         D             D7
You must tell him no.

[Chorus]
          G
But Don't forget who's taking you home
                         D
And in whose arms you're gonna be.
   A                  A7            D   D7
So darling, save the last dance for me.

[Chorus]
          G
But Don't forget who's taking you home
                         D
And in whose arms you're gonna be.
   A                  A7            D
So darling, save the last dance for me.
