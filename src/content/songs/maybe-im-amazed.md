title: "Maybe I'm Amazed"
---

```
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
And hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

Maybe I'm a girl
Maybe I'm a lonely girl who's in the middle of something
That she doesn't really understand

Maybe I'm a girl
And maybe you're the only man who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?

Maybe I'm a girl
Maybe I'm a lonely girl who's in the middle of something
That she doesn't really understand

Maybe I'm a girl
And maybe you're the only man who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?

Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
Right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you
```
