Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Though near or far

Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more

Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too

Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too
