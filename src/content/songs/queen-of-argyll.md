Dm
Gentle men it is my duty To inform you of one beauty
Dm                                (G C G C GCDm)
Though I'd ask you of a favor, no to seek her for awhile
Dm
Though I own she is a creature Of character and feature
Dm                                    Am           Dm
No words can paint the picture of the Queen of ole Argyll

[Chorus:]
And if you could have seen her there, boys if you had just been there
The swan was in her movement, and the morning in her smile
All the roses in the garden, they bow and ask her pardon
For not one could match the beauty of the queen of ole Argyll

On that evening that I mention, I passed with light intention
Through a part of our dear country known for beauty and for style
Bein' a place of noble thinkers, of scholars and great drinkers
But above them all for splendor shone the Queen of Ole Argyll

--chorus--

So my lads my needs must leave you, my intention not to grieve you
Nor indeed would I deceive you, oh I'll see you in awhile
I must find some way to gain her, to court her and to tame her
I fear my heart's in danger from the Queen of ole Argyll

--chorus--
