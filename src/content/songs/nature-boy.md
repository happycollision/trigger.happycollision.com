```
[Verse 1]
There was a boy
A very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far, over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

[Verse 2]
And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me:
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"
```
