[Intro]
A7   D

[Verse 1]
                                 A7
Goodbye, Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh
                                       D
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

[Chorus]
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and Fil√© gumbo
Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

[Verse 2]
Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
We dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

[ref:Chorus x 2]
