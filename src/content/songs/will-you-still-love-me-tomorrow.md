title: Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow
---

```
(Slow part, 11 bars uptempo, then a random bar of 6)

[Verse 1]
Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

[Verse 2]
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

[Bridge]
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

[Verse 3]
I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow

(7m rest, 16m solo, 16m solo, back on "Tonight with words unspoken")
