title: The Beat Goes On
---

```
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-de-da-de-de, la-de-da-de-da

Charleston was once the rage, ah-huh
History has turned the page, ah-huh
The miniskirt's the current thing, ah-huh
Teenybopper is our newborn king, ah-huh

And the beat goes on, the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-de-da-de-de, la-de-da-de-da

The grocery store's the super mart, ah-huh
Little girls still break their hearts, ah-huh
And men still keep on marching off to war
Electrically, they keep a baseball score

And the beat goes on, the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-de-da-de-de, la-de-da-de-da

(Band plays to the end)
