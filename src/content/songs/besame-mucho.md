title: "Besame Mucho"
---

```
(Long Intro)

Bésame, bésame mucho
Each time I cling to your kiss, I hear music divine
Bésame, bésame mucho
Hold me, my darling, and say that you'll always be mine
(Repeat)

(Bridge)
This joy is something new, my arms enfolding you
Never knew this thrill before
Whoever thought I'd be holding you close to me
Whispering "It's you I adore"

Dearest one, if you should leave me
Each little dream would take wing, and my life would be through
Bésame, bésame mucho
Love me forever and make all my dreams come true

```
