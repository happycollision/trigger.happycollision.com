G              C               G              D
Meet me in the morning I'll be Happy as a clown
       G               C           G                   D
You'll just be getting up And I'll still be getting down
    G               C         G                 D
The band is getting tired But they don't give a damn
   Em                        D
So blow the girls a kiss And give the boys a hand


Chorus:
G                C            G              D
You can take the Sunshine     I can take the Moonshine
G                C            G              D
You can take the high road    I can take the low
G                C            G               D
The later in the evening      The one thing I believe in
Em                                   G    D      G
I'm on the Road to Ruin     It's the only way to go

A penny in my pocket A bucket in the well
Then Saturday was Sunday And I could hear the bells
Deliver me from Evil Forgiveness and for love
You're heading for confession And I'm heading to the pub

--Chorus--

Bridge:
Em                      C
Nancy in the corner     Now I'm moving in
Em                                C
I thought I'd take me chances     But I took one on the chin
Em                           C
I finally got her number     She wrote it on a cup
Em                                        D
But I phoned her in the morning     And I woke her mudder up


Em Em C C  (x4)

She wished that I would go to bed I only wished her well
And then she told me Jesus said that I'd go straight to Hell
She's following His footsteps I'm following my nose
We're heading for the same place I'll see you down the road

--Chorus-- x2 (We're on the road to ruin..)

Em                                G    D      G
We're on the road to ruin its the only way to go!
