G
I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
C                             G
I wouldn't let my dear savior in
G
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
G                D         G
Praise the Lord, I saw the light


G
I saw the light, I saw the light
C                         G
No more darkness, no more night
G
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
G                D         G
Praise the Lord, I saw the light


G
Just like a blind man I wandered along
C                                  G
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
G
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
G                D         G
Praise the Lord, I saw the light


G
I saw the light, I saw the light
C                         G
No more darkness, no more night
G
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
G                D         G
Praise the Lord, I saw the light


G
I was a fool to wander and stray
C                                       G
For straight is the gate and narrow the way
G
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
G                D         G
Praise the Lord, I saw the light


G
I saw the light, I saw the light
C                         G
No more darkness, no more night
G
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
G                D         G
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
