[Don's recording without drums](/rehearse/parting-glass.mp3)

Only for the recitative intro, during "I spent it in good company": Skip the G
and D, and also replace A with D. This is kind of optional, and is how you'd
hear it in the
[Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem Carnegie Hall concert from 1963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkb94eXqcrM)

So it looks like this just for the intro:

```
   Bm                     D
I spent it in good company

```

Here is the tab for how I play "All I've done for want of wit"

```

|---2--2-------2---4---2------
|---4--4---4---4---5---4------
|----------5------------------
|-----------------------------
   And all---- I've--- done,
   for want--- of---   wit
```

```
Maybe easier?

   And all---- I've--- done,

Here's the whole song

```
[Intro/Verse 1]
   Bm      G          D      A7
Oh all the money that e'er I spent
   Bm      G       D     A
I spent it in good company
    Bm      G         D         A7
And all the harm that e'er I've done
  Bm  G  D   A  G        Bm
Alas, it was to none but me


[Chorus 1]

    D   G    D        D    G  D
And all I've done for want of wit
   G/E    A/C    D     A7
To memory now I can't recall
   Bm     (Bm)   D       A7
So fill to me the parting glass
     Bm    G   D   A  G        Bm
Good night and joy be with you all


[Verse 2]

If I had money enough to spend
And leisure time to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in this town
That sorely has my heart beguiled


[Chorus 2]

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all


[Instrumental]

Bm G D A

Bm  G  D   A  G        Bm


[Verse 3]

Oh all the comrades that e'er I've had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I've had
Theyâ€™d wish me one more day to stay


[Chorus 3]

But since it falls unto my lot
That I  should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all


[Instrumental]
