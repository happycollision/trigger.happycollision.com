[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Layne Staley]
Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stingin' sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere, mm-mm
Wife and kids, household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere, mm-mm

[Chorus: Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell]
Here they come to snuff the Rooster, aw, yeah
Yeah, here come the Rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell]
Here they come to snuff the Rooster, aw, yeah
Yeah, here come the Rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die
