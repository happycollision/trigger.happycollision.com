Hey little SANTA, We GOTTA RUN!
Hey little SANTA, CAN WE HAVE SOME FUN?
Hey little SANTA, IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS TIME.
Hey little SANTA, WE’RE OFF INTO THE NIGHT!
Hey little SANTA, shotgun!
It's a nice day to SNOW again
It's a nice day for a white CHRISTMAS
It's a nice day to SNOW again(normal, short)

Hey little SANTA, who is it you're with? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey little SANTA, what's THEIR WISH OR GIFT (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey little SANTA, EGGNOG, oh yeah
Hey little SANTA, WHERE’S THE MISTLETOE?
Hey little SANTA, shotgun
It's a nice day to SNOW AGAIN!
It's a nice day for a white CHRISTMAS
It's a nice day to (long, high) SNOW again, ow!

(Instrumental)
Pick it up
Take me to the North Pole
Hey little SANTA, Is your list done? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey little SANTA, who's THE NAUGHTY ONES? (Only one)
YOU’ve been away for so long (so long)
YOU’ve been away for so long (so long)
AT THE NORTH POLE for so long
It's a nice day to SNOW again
Come on, it's a nice day for a white CHRISTMAS
It's a nice day to SNOW again, ow!
There is JOY TO SHARE in this world
There are TOYS TO SHARE in this world
And there's SOMETHING NICE in this world
And there's LOTS OF SPICE in this world
Look UNDER THE TREE in this world
Start again
Come on, it's a nice day for a white CHRISTMAS
Wow, it's a nice day to SLED again. REPEAT. REPEAT.
