title: I'm Beginning To See The Light
---

```
(Intro – 8 measures)
I never cared much for moonlit skies, I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes, I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow, Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low, I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park, Shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark, That's a four-alarm fire, now

I never made love by lantern shine, I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine, I'm beginning to see the light

(Band – 16 bars – scat if you want to)
(Piano solo – 8 Bars)
(Band – 8 Bars)

Used to ramble through the park, Shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark, That's a four-alarm fire, now

I never made love by lantern shine, I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine, I'm beginning to see the light
I’m beginning to see the light, Oh I did that crazy light… etc…
