[Verse]
Well, my name it is Mike Dempsey and I leaving in the morning
I got a pocket full of money and I giving you fair warning
I'm here to stir some trouble up and make the rafters roar
Hide your wife and daughters cause I'm kicking in the door!

[Chorus]
So come on, boys, drink em up, boys
The girls are waiting, there's no better time than now
Raise your glasses up, drink up every drop
The whiskey's flowing, there's no stopping us now

[Verse]
Some would say I'm good (real good!), but when I'm bad I'm better (the best!)
I've got a girl in every town and a box full of love letters
I'm no officer or gentlemen, I'm just a handsome rover
I've fought the devil, I've cheated death, I'm a walking four leaf clover!

[Chorus]

Pick your poison what'll it be? Fill em up with brandy and wine
Line em up, Johnny, on the bar you know I like em fine
After I finished those bottles I said, "I'm just getting started"
But a fight broke out and the coppers ran in, that's when I departed!

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
