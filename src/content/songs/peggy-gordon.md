    G     D          G      D  A
Oh, Peggy Gordon you are my darling
     G       D            A
Come sit you down upon my knee
G            D  G         D  A
Come tell to me  the very reason
G        D        A     D
Why I am slighted so by thee

I'm so in love I can't deny it
My heart lies smothered in my breast
It's not for you to let the world know it
A troubled mind can know no rest

I did put my head to a cask of brandy
It was my fancy I do declare
For when I'm drinking I am thinking
And wishing Peggy Gordon was here


[Instrumental]


I wish I was in some lonesome valley
Where womankind can not be found
Where the pretty small birds do sing o'er the branches
And every moment a different sound

Oh, Peggy Gordon you are my darling
Come sit you down upon my knee
Come tell to me  the very reason
Why I am slighted so by thee

Why I am slighted so by thee


```
