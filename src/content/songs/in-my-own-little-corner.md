title: In My Own Little Corner
---

```
I'm as mild and as meek as a mouse
When I hear a command I obey.
But I know of a spot in my house
where no one can stand in my way.

In my own little corner in my own little chair
I can be whatever I want to be.
On the wings of my fancy I can fly anywhere
and the world will open its arms to me.

I'm a young Egyptian princess or a milkmaid
I'm the greatest prima donna in Milan
I'm an heiress who has always had her silk made
By her own flock of silkworms in Japan

I'm a girl men go mad for love's a game I can play with a
cool and confident kind of air.

Just as long as I stay in my own little corner
All alone in my own little chair.
I can be whatever I want to be.

I'm a thief from Calcutta I'm a queen in Peru.
I'm a mermaid dancing upon the sea
I'm a huntress on an African safari..
it's a dangerous type of sport and yet it's fun
In the night I sally forth to seek my quarry
And I find I forgot to bring my gun.

I am lost in the jungle all alone and unarmed
when I meet a lioness in her lair
Then I'm glad to be back in my own little corner,
All alone in my own little chair.
