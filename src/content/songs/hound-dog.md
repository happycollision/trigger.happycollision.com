```
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Just cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time

Well, you ain't never caught no rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
Well, they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie

Yeah they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, you ain't never caught no rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
```
