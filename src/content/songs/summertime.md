```
Summertime, and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good lookin'
So hush, little baby, don't you cry

One of these mornings, you're gonna rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning, there's a'nothing can harm you
With daddy and mammy standing by
```
