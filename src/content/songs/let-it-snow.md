(Get G from band, 3 m drums then I start it)

(Get G from band, 3 m drums then I start it)

Oh the weather outside is frightful,
and the fire is so delightful.
Since we’ve no place to go.
Let It Snow! (Let It) Snow! (Let It) Snow!

Oh It doesn’t show signs of stopping,
And I’ve brought some corn for popping.
The lights are turned way down low.
Let It Snow! (Let It) Snow! (Let It) Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight,
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight,
all the way home I’ll be warm.

Oh the fire is slowly dying,
and, my dear, we’re still good-bying.
As long as you love me so.
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It (REST) Snow!

(Long long long Band part- ending in crazy horn part)

When we finally kiss goodnight,
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight,
all the way home I’ll be warm.

Oh the fire is slowly dying,
and, my dear, we’re still good-bying.
As long as you love me so.
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let it snow!
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow snow snow snow doobedoobedoo, let it snow.
