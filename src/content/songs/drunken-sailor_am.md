```
[Verse 1]
Am
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
G
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
Am                       C
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
G      E      Am
Ear-ly in the morning


[Chorus]
Weigh, hey, and up she rises
Weigh, hey, and up she rises
Weigh, hey, and up she rises
Ear-ly in the morning


[Verse 2]
Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober
Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober
Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober
Ear-ly in the morning


Pull out the plug and wet him all over

Put him in the bilge and make him drink it

Put him in a leaky boat and make him bale her

Tie him to the scuppers with the hose pipe on him

Shave his belly with a rusty razor

Tie him to the topmast while she's yardarm under

Heave him by the leg in a runnin' bowline

Keel haul him 'til he's sober

Put him in the brig with the captain's daughter


Am
That's what we do with the drunken sailor!
G
That's what we do with the drunken sailor!
Am                         C
That's what we do with the drunken sailor!
G      E      Am
Ear-ly in the morning


[Chorus]
