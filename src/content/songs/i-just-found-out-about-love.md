title: "I Just Found Out About Love"
---

```
I just found out about love and I like it, I like it
I like what love has been doing to me
I hold you close in my arms and I like it, yes I like it

Oh, what a wonderful future I see
It's a one time only, it's a lifetime deal
Somehow I feel that it's real, I can tell by the way that I feel

Right now, I'm living it up and I like it, yes I like it
Hey you, give me a clue, what's love doing to you
It looks like you could be liking it too

Well it's a one time only, it's a lifetime deal
Somehow I feel that it's real, I can tell by the way that I feel

Well right now, I'm living it up and I like it, yes I like it
I say hey you, give me a clue, what's love doing to you
It looks like you could be liking it too

Yes it looks like you could be liking it too
