   G               C             G            D
As I walked out on Broadway, one evening last July
  G              C                  G        D       G
I met a maid she asked me trade, "a sailor lad" says I
To Tiffany's I took her I didn’t mind expense
I bought her a pair of gold earrings, they cost me fifteen cents

Chorus (twice every time)
Away Santee My Dear Annie
  Oh, you New York girls can't you dance the polka?

And she says, 'You Limejuice sailor Now see me home you may'
But when we reached her cottage door She this to me did say:
“My flash man he's a Yankee With his hair cut short behind
He wears a pair of black sea-boots And he sails in the Blackball Line”

--CHORUS--

And He's homeward bound this evening And with me he will stay
So get a move on, sailor-boy Get cracking on your way
I kissed her hard and proper Afore her flash man came
So fare thee well, you Bowery girl I know your little game

--CHORUS--

And then I wrapped me glad rags round me And to the docks did steer
I will never court another girl I'll stick to rum and beer
I joined a Yankee blood-boat And sailed away next morn
Don't mess around with women boys You're safer ‘round Cape Horn

--CHORUS--
```
