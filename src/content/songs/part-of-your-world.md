title: Part of Your World

```
Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't ya think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't ya think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?

Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything

I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whosits and whatsits galore
You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'
Walkin' around on those -
What do ya call 'em? Oh, feet
Flippin' your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
Strollin' along down a -
What's that word again? Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free, wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give if I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day
Warm on the sand?

Betcha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women, sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it -
What's the word? Burn

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea, wish I could be
Part of that world
