title: Forget About The Boy
---

```
No canary in a cage for me
This canary's ready to fly free

Cut the cord
Is that a man I once adored?
He's nothing but an albatross
No great loss
Doublecrosser
Forget about the boy
Pull the plug
Ain't he the one who pulled the rug
He's lower than an alley cat
Dirty rat
And I flatter
Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy

And in the moonlight
Don't you think about him
Sister, you're much better off without him
You can blow the blues a kiss goodbye
And put the sun back in the sky
For when he comes crawlin'
I'm not fallin'

Shout hooray and halleluh!
Now me and mister wrong are through
I'll find myself another beau
Who I know is no rover

Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy
Forget about - (Jordan cuts to new key)

Jimmy, oh Jimmy, silly boy
Get what a real swell guy,
Forget about the boy
Jimmy oh Jimmy, oh what joy
He makes my troubles fly

Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy
(We are ending it somehow)
Forget about the boy!
```
