[Intro]

| C   | C   | F   | C   |
| F   | C   | C G | C


[Verse 1]

          C
The other night dear as I lay sleeping
            F              C
I dreamed I held you in my arms
        F                  C
When I awoke dear I was mistaken
     C        G          C
So I bowed my head and I cried


[Chorus]

           C
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
            F                    C
You make me happy when skies are gray
             F                     C
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
             C       G         C
Please don't take my sunshine away


[Instrumental]

| C   | C   | F   | C   |
| F   | C   | C G | C


[Verse 2]

            C
I've always loved you and made you happy
            F                  C
and nothing else could come between
               F                 C
but now you've left me to love another
         C           G       C
you have shattered all of my dreams


[Chorus]

           C
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
            F                    C
You make me happy when skies are gray
             F                     C
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
             C       G          C  C/F  C/E  C
Please don't take my sunshine away
