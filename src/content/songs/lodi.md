title: Lodi

```
[Verse 1]
Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune
And lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

[Verse 2]
Rode in on the Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friend
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

[Verse 3]
The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
I ran out of songs to play
I came into town a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
```
