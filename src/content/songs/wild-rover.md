[Verse 1]
     G                            C
I've been a wild rover for many a year
   G                D           G
My money I spent on whiskey and beer
     G                                   C
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
      G                        D        G
And I never will play the wild rover no more


[Chorus]
          D                [silence]
And it's "No, nay, never!" [audience: clap clap clap clap]
G                    C           G             C
  No, nay, never, no more will I play the wild rover
       G    D    G
No, never,    no more.


I went to an ale house I used to frequent
And I told the landlady my money's all spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me "Nay!"
"Such credit of your's I can have any day"


[Chorus]


I pulled from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She said "I have whiskey and wines all the best!"
"And those words that I told you were only in jest!"


[Chorus]


I'll go to my parents, confess what I've done
And ask them to forgive their prodigal son
And once they've caressed me as oft times before
I never shall play the wild rover no more

[Chorus]

[Chorus, audience competition on "play"]
