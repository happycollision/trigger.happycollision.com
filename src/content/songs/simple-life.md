title: Give Me the Simple Life
---

```
I don't believe in frettin' or grievin'
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life
Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
Those things roll off my knife
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small is all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A home that's full of joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I'll take the low road
Free from the care and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but, yes, indeedy
Give me the simple life

Ah, I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small is all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A home that's full of joy and laughter
The ones you love inside

Some the high road, I like the low road
Free from the care and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but, yes, indeedy
Give me the simple life

Give me the simple life
```
