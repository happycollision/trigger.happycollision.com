title: I Remember You
---

```
I remember you
You're the one who
Made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago

I remember you
You're the one who
Said I love you, too
I do, didn'tcha know?

I remember, too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you

(Band)

I remember, too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Just like the rain out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you
