[Intro]

A  D  A  D  A  D  E
A  D  A  D  A  D  E


[Chorus]

    A        D
The boys are back

The boys are back
    A        D
The boys are back
            E
And they're looking for trouble

[Verse (same chords as everything else)]

A               D         A  D
Standing on the highway on 93
    A          D              E
I'm missing my home, and it's killing me
Down the ramp passed the jail, I'm feeling alright
Bought roses for my ladies from a corner delight

It's time to get ready for that song and dance
Let's go my friends, it's time to take a chance
We're back in town, we're gonna get it done
We got nowhere to hide, we got nowhere to run

D                     E
It's been a long time coming,
D                     E
It's been a long time coming,


[Chorus 2 times]


[Interlude]

A  D  A  D  A  D  E


[Verse 2]

If that old familiar city could talk in here
You'd be just another nobody, you'd disappear
Your days are numbered, we're back around
We're coming for you and you're going down

D                     E
It's been a long time coming,
D                     E
It's been a long time coming,


[Chorus 2 times]


D                    E
And we're coming for you
D                    E
And we're coming for you


[Chorus 4 times]


[Outro]

    A  D  A  D  A  D  E
For you

A  D  A  D  A  D  E
