title: I Told Ya I Love Ya
---

```
[Verse 1]
I told ya I love ya, now get out
I told ya I love ya, now get out
Everything's rosy and everything's jake
But just how much can a good gal take?
I told ya I love ya, now get out

[Verse 2]
There may be times when I need you, there's no doubt
Baby, now you're something I can do without
Leave your number and go on home
But don't wait with sandwiches by the phone
I told ya I love ya, now get out

[Bridge]
Baby, please leave me be
You want a puppet and there's no strings on me

[Verse 3]
Get hip, you can leave on the 5:18
Now don't go 'way sayin' I've been mean
like any gal I can change my ways
a round trip ticket's good for sixty days
I told ya I love ya, now get out

Man, get lost for now
```
