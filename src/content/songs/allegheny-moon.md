G         C
Allegheny Moon, I need your light,

to help me find, romance tonight.
           C7     Dm7
So, shine, shine, shine.
          G                 G7
Allegheny Moon, your silver beams,
             G             G7
can lead the way to golden dreams.
    G      G7     C
So, shine, shine, shine.


G              C
High among the stars, so bright, above..

the magic of your lamp, of love,
    C7       F    A
can make him mine.
          Dm7              F
Allegheny Moon, it's up to you..
       C                A
please see what you can do..
    Dm7            G            C
for me, and for my one and only love.


[repeat from top of song]

G(7)                  G7       C
Shine on me tonight, Allegheny Moon.
