title: Come Rain or Come Shine
---

```
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't you ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
We'll be happy together, unhappy together
Now won't that be just fine?

The days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
I'm with you, baby
I'm with you rain or shine
```
